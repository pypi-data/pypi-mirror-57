Description: # OXASL_MP
        
        Plugin for the OXASL pipeline to support multiphase ASL data.
        
        The multiphase data is fitted to the multiphase model and the
        output magnitude is used as the differenced output for 
        conventional ASL modelling
        
        ## Issues
        
        One issue is that for multi-PLD data the phase offset map
        is not shared between PLDs. To solve this problem we need to
        modify the multiphase model to accept multi-PLD data directly.
