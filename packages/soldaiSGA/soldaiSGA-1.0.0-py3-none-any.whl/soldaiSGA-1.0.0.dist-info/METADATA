# Simple Genetic Algorithm
This repo is a Simple Genetic Algorithm Implemented in python, if you are interested in this you can use it to make experiments about how the genetic algorithms work

## Classes
Coin: Simple class which represents a loaded coin to make decissions using specific probabilities. It comes handy to make decissions about crossing and mutations in the individuals

Individual: Simple class representing an individual consisiting on a chromosome made of 1's and 0's

SGA: Simple Genetic Algorithm Class to make evolutionary systems

## Evolution Strategy
This code implements a simple evolution strategy consisting of evaluation, selection, cross, mutation and replacement. It is executed usign the runGeneration method of the class
