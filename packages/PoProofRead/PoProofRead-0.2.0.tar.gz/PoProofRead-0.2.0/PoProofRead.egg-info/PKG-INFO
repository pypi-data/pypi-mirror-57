Description: PoProofRead is a simple application for fast and easy proofreading and
        commenting of po and podiff files.
        
        # Introduction
        
        PoProofRead is made for the task of reviewing and commenting on the contents
        of po or podiff files. It does this by allowing the user to easily:
        
         * Move through the parts of the file with a single keypress
         * Start writing a comment without any activation of editing
         * Save the current state of the proofreading work
         * Output only the parts of the file that there are comments to
         * Switch below of inline commenting for each individual part
