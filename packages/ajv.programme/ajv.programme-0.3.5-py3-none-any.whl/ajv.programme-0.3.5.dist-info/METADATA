programme
=========

programme is a program that writes programmes.

This isn't really intended for general use. It's something I put
together so someone I know could make nice-ish music-recital programmes,
without having to manually futz with word processor layouts.  But if you
run across it on pypi, you're welcome to use it.

Quick Start
-----------

Install Python 3 and ``pip`` if they're not already present.

Install ``programme`` and generate a starting file:

::

    pip3 install ajv.programme
    programme --init > students.tsv


Open ``students.tsv`` in your spreadsheet program of choice. It may
prompt you for import settings; the only relevant one is the delimiter,
which should be a tab.

Fill in the columns on the spreadsheet. Anything left blank will be
ignored. Save when done. Then:

::

    programme students.tsv output.html

That's it. Open output.html and you should get something usable. If you
specified student images in the tsv file, and if those files are present
in the same directory, they'll be included in the output.

You can run ``programme --help`` to see additional options.
