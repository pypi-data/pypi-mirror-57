    Creates a tar.gz tarball of the provided directory and returns the tarball's name.

        input_dir: `str`. Path to the directory to tar up.

        compress: `boolean`. True enables gzip compression. Not recommended with the latest types of
            Illumina runs, i.e. NovaSeq, since the files are mostly binary which isn't compressible. 
            For example, I compressed a 428 GB NovaSeq run with 'tar -zcf' and the output was 422 GB.
