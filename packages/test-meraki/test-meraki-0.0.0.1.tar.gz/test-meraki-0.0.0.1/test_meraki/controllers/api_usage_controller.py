        List the API requests made by an organization

        Args:
            organization_id (string): TODO: type description here. Example: 
            t_0 (string, optional): The beginning of the timespan for the
                data. The maximum lookback period is 31 days from today.
            t_1 (string, optional): The end of the timespan for the data. t1
                can be a maximum of 31 days after t0.
            timespan (float, optional): The timespan for which the information
                will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify
                parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less
                than or equal to 31 days. The default is 31 days.
            per_page (int, optional): The number of entries per page returned.
                Acceptable range is 3 - 1000. Default is 50.
            starting_after (string, optional): A token used by the server to
                indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or
                an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should
                not be defined by client applications. The link for the first,
                last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define
                it.
            ending_before (string, optional): A token used by the server to
                indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an
                ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not
                be defined by client applications. The link for the first,
                last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define
                it.
            admin_id (string, optional): Filter the results by the ID of the
                admin who made the API requests
            path (string, optional): Filter the results by the path of the API
                requests
            method (string, optional): Filter the results by the method of the
                API requests (must be 'GET', 'PUT', 'POST' or 'DELETE')
            response_code (int, optional): Filter the results by the response
                code of the API requests
            source_ip (string, optional): Filter the results by the IP address
                of the originating API request

        Returns:
            object: Response from the API. Successful operation

        Raises:
            APIException: When an error occurs while fetching the data from
                the remote API. This exception includes the HTTP Response
                code, an error message, and the HTTP body that was received in
                the request.
