"""
Implementation of 4-point rainflow counting algorithm in numpy. The
implementation and terminology is based on the following resources:

    `C. Amzallag et. al. Standardization of the rainflow counting method for
    fatigue analysis. International Journal of Fatigue, 16 (1994) 287-293`

    `ISO 12110-2, Metallic materials - Fatigue testing - Variable amplitude
     fatigue testing.`

    `G. Marsh et. al. Review and application of Rainflow residue processing
    techniques for accurate fatigue damage estimation. International Journal
    of Fatigue, 82 (2016) 757-765`

Note that there are two functions for finding the reversals.

    * `find_reversals_strict` passes the example provided in ISO12110-2 by
    ensuring that data points which fall on a load class boundary are rounded
    upwards if the reversal is a peak and downwards if it is a valley.

    * `find_reversals` classifies the data points by rounding the datapoints
    which lies on the boundary to the lower load class. This function is more
    efficient than the strict version, and yields practically identical results
    if the number of load classes is set sufficiently high.
