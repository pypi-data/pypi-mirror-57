file: graph_setlike_operations.py

Functions to perform Python [set-like](https://docs.python.org/3/library/
stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) operation on graphs.

These functions aim to return a view-based result graph (subgraph) as often
as possible by checking if the input graphs share te same origin graph.
If returning a view is not possible or explicitly not requested the returned
graph is based on a deep copy of the first graph provided as argument to the
function.

The set-like combinatorial operations are based on (dis)-similarity in node
and edge ID's regardless of the `auto_nid` setting.
Set-like operations based on node and/or edge attributes is possible by first
performing a node/edge query followed by the set operation.

A general concept in (graphit) Graphs is that nodes do not need to have edges
but edges cannot exist without their respective nodes. While union and
intersection operations will always return graphs that meet these requirements,
difference operations do not. If the difference between two graphs is an edge
returning that edge alone as Graph object without the corresponding nodes is
not allowed. Therefore, by default, the difference functions are node oriented.
In calculating the difference between a sub graph and its parent graph this
approach will result in a desired graph subtraction operation where the edges
linking sub graph and parent are removed.
However, these functions have a `edge_diff` flag that will switch the function
to calculate the edge oriented difference that will include nodes to return a
valid graph.

.. note:: These functions do not update node and/or edge attributes in the
          resulting graph as might be required in for instance a union or
          intersection operation.
