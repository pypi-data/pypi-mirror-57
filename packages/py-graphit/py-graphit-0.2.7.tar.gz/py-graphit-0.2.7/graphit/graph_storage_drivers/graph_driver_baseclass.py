"""
Storage driver abstract base class

Graphit uses dedicated data stores for node and edge data. Access is enabled
using an API that reassembles a Python dictionary with a node or edge ID as
'key' and a node/edge data dictionary as 'value'.

The API is formalized in the `GraphDriverBaseClass` base class that defines
abstract and derived methods required for the dict-like API similar to the
'MutableMapping' abstract base class from the `collections` module.
The data stores are decoupled from the main graph object structure by weak
referencing through Pythons `weakref` module.

The `GraphDriverBaseClass` uses data 'views' to allow instances of the driver
class to represent a subset of nodes/edges while still having the same weak
reference to the full data storage object. A 'view' is a simple list (_view)
storing the node/edge primary keys.

The `GraphDriverBaseClass` facilitates easy creation of different storage
backends that can be transparently used as Python dictionaries in graphit
graphs.

.. note::
    The developer of new a new storage driver is responsible for initializing
    an empty '_view' list and providing support for 'views' in the
    implementation of the abstract methods.

    Abstract base class for graph data storage drivers

    This is the boilerplate class for the implementation of node and edge
    storage driver classes in graphit.
    It exposes a Python dict-like API by using the 'MutableMapping' abstract
    base class from the 'collections' module. In addition it implements
    support for several methods to provide support for list-like method and
    rich set-like comparison methods.

    The following abstract methods from the 'MutableMapping' class are
    required:

        * __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, __iter__, __len__

    The following abstract methods for dictionary 'view' like iteration are
    required:

        * iterkeys, itervalues, iteritems

    All other methods are derived from the abstract methods but may be
    overloaded if it benefits efficiency for a given storage backend for
    instance.

    .. note::

        please note that the 'GraphDriverBaseClass' uses data 'views' to
        allow instances of the driver class to represent a subset of nodes
        edges while still having the same weak reference to the full data
        storage object. A 'view' is a simple list (_view) storing the node
        edge primary keys.
        The empty '_view' list needs to be initialized by the storage driver
        and support for 'views' needs to be implemented for the abstract
        methods.

        Implement Python 2.7 dictionary like 'values' iterator method that
        returns a view on the values in the data store.
        It redirects the call to the `itervalues` method which is the Python
        3.x equivalent and abstract method.

        :return: data values
        :rtype:  values view instance
        """

        return self.itervalues()
