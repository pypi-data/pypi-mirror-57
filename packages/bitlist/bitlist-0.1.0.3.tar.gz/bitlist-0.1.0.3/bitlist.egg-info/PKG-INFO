        Purpose
        -------
        This library allows programmers to work with a little-endian representation of bit strings within Python. Its purpose is primarily pedagogical, although it can be useful under other circumstances.
        
        Package Installation and Usage
        ------------------------------
        The package is available on PyPI::
        
            python -m pip install bitlist
        
        The library can be imported in the usual way::
        
            import bitlist
            from bitlist import bitlist
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        The library comes with a number of tests::
        
            nosetests
        
        Examples
        --------
        An example of usage (a bitwise addition function) is provided  below::
        
            from bitlist import bitlist
            def add(x, y):
                k = len(x)
                l = len(y)
                r = bitlist(0)
                c = 0
                for i in range(0, max(k,l)): # Upper bound is not inclusive.
                    r[i] = (x[i] ^ y[i]) ^ c
                    c = (x[i] & y[i]) | (x[i] & c) | (y[i] & c)
                r[max(k,l)] = c
                return r
