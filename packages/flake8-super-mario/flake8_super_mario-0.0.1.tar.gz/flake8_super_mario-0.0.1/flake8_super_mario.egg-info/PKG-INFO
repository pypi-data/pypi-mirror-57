Description: # flake8-super-mario
        
        An extension for flake8 with super_mario specific validations.
        
        [Mario](https://github.com/best-doctor/Mario) is a framework for business
        logic flow. It's best when user follows all rules.
        Some rules are checked by Mario itself and some are best with
        static analysis and can be checked with this plugin.
