# in-toolset

in-toolset is an editor and (basic) simulator for industry workflow nets (inets), a model of interorganisational workflows based on petrinets.

Currently, the tool supports editing and manually simulating these industry workflows, and exporting industry nets as PNML petri nets, but support for checking for bisimilarity using LTSmin and for generating the language of triggering sequences of an inet in XES is planned, as is a model of "domains" for organisations and messages.

The toolset was originally created by: Daniel Otten, Jakob Wuhrer, Julia Bolt, Ricardo Schaaf, and Yannik Marchand, on behalf of Pieter Kwantes of Leiden University.
