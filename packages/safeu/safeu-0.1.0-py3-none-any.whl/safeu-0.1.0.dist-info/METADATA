## Introduction

**SafeU** (Safe learning for Unlabeled data), is a python toolkit of safe machine learning algorithms utilizing unlebeled data (A brief introduction of safe semi-supervised learning can be found [**here**](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/liyf/paper/FCS19-SafeSSL.pdf)). It builds in multiple safe semi-supervised learning algorithms, and provide a weakly-supervised learning experiment framework including some well-defined protocols for learning algorithms, experiments and evaluation metrics. With this toolkit, you build up your comparing experiments between learning algorithms with different learning settings like supervised, semi/weakly-supervised, as well as different tasks such as single/multi-label learning. We hope this toolkit could help you explore the classic semi-supervised learning algorithms and go further to test your ones.

## Getting Start
* For the latest news, blog posts, tutorials, papers, etc. related to SafeU, check out ([Need a official release website](https://git.nju.edu.cn/lamda/safeu))
* Get [set up](https://git.nju.edu.cn/lamda/safeu#Setup) quickly
* Try the ([tutorial](https://git.nju.edu.cn/lamda/SafeU/blob/develop/example/Tutorials.ipynb)).
* Read the ([documents](https://git.nju.edu.cn/lamda/SafeU/blob/develop/docs/build/docs.zip)).


## Setup

You can get safeu simply by:

```
pip install SafeU
```

Or clone safeu source code to your local directory and build from source:

```
cd SafeU
python setup.py safeu
pip install dist/*.whl
```

The dependencies of SafeU are:
1. Python dependency

```
python == 3.6 | 3.7
```

2. Basic Dependencies

```
numpy >= 1.15.1
scipy >= 1.1.0
scikit-learn >= 0.19.2
cvxopt >= 1.2.0
```

## Examples
We can use safeu for algorithm experiments. The following example shows a possible way to experiment based on built-in algorithms and data sets:
```python
import sys, os
from safeu.Experiments import SslExperimentsWithoutGraph
from safeu.model_uncertainty.S4VM import S4VM

# algorithm configs
configs = [
        ('S4VM', S4VM(), {
            'kernel': 'RBF',
            'gamma':[0],
            'C1': [50,100],
            'C2': [0.05,0.1],
            'sample_time':[100]
        })
    ]

# datasets
# name,feature_file,label_file,split_path,graph_file
datasets = [
	('house', None, None, None, None),
	('isolet', None, None, None, None)
	]

# experiments
experiments = SslExperimentsWithoutGraph(transductive=True, n_jobs=4)
experiments.append_configs(configs)
experiments.append_datasets(datasets)
experiments.set_metric(performance_metric='accuracy_score')

results = experiments.experiments_on_datasets(unlabel_ratio=0.75,test_ratio=0.2,
	number_init=2)
```
