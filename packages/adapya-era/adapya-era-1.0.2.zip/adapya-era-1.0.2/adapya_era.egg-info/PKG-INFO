Description: *adapya-era* - services library of the Event Replicator for Adabas

        ==========
        
        *adapya-era* is a services library of the Event Replicator for Adabas.
        
        The Event Replicator for Adabas is an add-on product to Adabas that allows replicating
        database data to other systems. Client programs (also called target adapters) receive
        event replication data through a messaging system like MQ series or EntireX Broker.
        
        adapya-era can be used to write target adapters in Python.
        
        The package also consists of scripts that can send requests to the Replicator and
        receive event data via the EntireX Broker messaging system.
        
        adapya-era requires the following adapya packages: adapya.adabas, adapya.base
        and adapya.entirex
        
        Prerequisite for adapya is Python version 2.7 or 3.5 and above.
