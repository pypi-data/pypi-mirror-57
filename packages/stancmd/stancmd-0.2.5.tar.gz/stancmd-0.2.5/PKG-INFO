        ## What is stancmd ?
        Stancmd is a simple python package / script that launches the command you pass it
        after waiting four hours. However, as it calls `subprocess` it does **not**
        handle aliases or shell builtins. It also catches some signals in order to keep
        waiting.
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install --user stancmd`
        
        ## Usage

        ### As a package (after installing via pip)
