Overview
========


Version v0.0.26.
----------------


This is a proof of concept package. It came out of my disdain for typing any sort of HTML tag.

I often code inside of `Jupyter notebooks`_. Sometimes I want to display custom HTML inside of those notebooks.

The issue is that writing complex HTML such as a list by hand is tedious and error-prone. Template libraries do help, but they introduce their own clumsy syntax into HTML. And the templates are often very long strings that clutter the notebook. Storing the templates in files takes my mind away from the notebooks. 

Then I discovered the template library Chameleon_ that uses valid HTML as its template. Brilliant!

Though I would still have to type the templates which are HTML tags which takes me back to my original disdain of typing HTML tags.

This library addresses that issue. It also adds some utilities that I use when coding inside notebooks.

`Here is an example`_ where I used chamelboots to insert a link menu into a notebook. The links were references to anchor tags inserted into a very long cell output. It made it easier to navigate the output.
