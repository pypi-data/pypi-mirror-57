PyVerm
======

What is PyVerm?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyVerm is a Python-Package for geodetic and surveying calculations. The main focus
is on calculations for surveying in switzerland, but PyVerm should be as versatile
as possible. In addition to its use in education and research, it should also be
possible to use it as a component for software development.

PyVerm is currently in its first phase of development.


How to install PyVerm?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install PyVerm with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyverm

**Requirements** Python 3.6 or higher

How to use PyVerm?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more examples and information's you should visit the `documentation <https://pyverm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyverm

    standpoint = pyverm.Point(2600000, 1200000, 0)
    orientation = 123.4567

    station = pyverm.station(standpoint, orientation)
    new_point = station.survey(pyverm.ObservationPolar(
                                   reduced_horizontal_angle=375.00,
                                   reduced_distance=575.1234
                                   )
                               )

    azimuth = pyverm.azimuth(standpoint, new_point)
