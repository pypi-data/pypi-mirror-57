## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Local development
The project uses poetry as a dependency management tool. For local development convenient way to installing and
running project is using `poetry install`. Please, use [>=1.0.0 version](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/#history) of
poetry even if it is a beta-version.

Poetry automatically creates venv (or uses already activated venv) and install all requirements to it and the project
itself as `editable` .
TIP: Use `poetry shell` or `poetry run` before running commands: they activate venv. If you want to connect venv to
your IDE, use `poetry env list --full-path`
