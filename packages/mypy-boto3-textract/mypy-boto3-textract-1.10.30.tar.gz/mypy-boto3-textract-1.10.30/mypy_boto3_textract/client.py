        Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.

        The types of information returned are as follows:

        * Words and lines that are related to nearby lines and words. The related information is
        returned in two  Block objects each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET`` : a KEY Block object and a
        VALUE Block object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and value.
        *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value.

        * Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected
        table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.

        * Selectable elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object
        contains information about a selectable element.

        * Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects.

        You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the ``FeatureTypes`` list.

        The output is returned in a list of ``BLOCK`` objects.

         ``AnalyzeDocument`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use
         StartDocumentAnalysis .

          The input document as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI
          to call Amazon Textract operations, you can't pass image bytes. The document must be an
          image in JPG or PNG format.

          If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode
          image bytes passed using the ``Bytes`` field.

          - **Bytes** *(bytes) --*

            A blob of base-64 encoded documents bytes. The maximum size of a document that's
            provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB. The document bytes must be in PNG or JPG format.

            If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode
            image bytes passed using the ``Bytes`` field.

          - **S3Object** *(dict) --*

            Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size of a document stored in
            an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

            - **Bucket** *(string) --*

              The name of the S3 bucket.

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              The file name of the input document. It must be an image file (.JPG or .PNG format).
              Asynchronous operations also support PDF files.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --*

              Metadata about the analyzed document. An example is the number of pages.

              - **Pages** *(integer) --*

                The number of pages detected in the document.

            - **Blocks** *(list) --*

              The text that's detected and analyzed by ``AnalyzeDocument`` .

              - *(dict) --*

                A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
                pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` depends on the
                type of operation. In document-text detection (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
                you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis
                (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields,
                tables and selection elements that are detected in the document.

                An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous
                operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of
                ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as
                GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

                For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__ .

                - **BlockType** *(string) --*

                  The type of text that's recognized in a block. In text-detection operations, the
                  following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child Block objects that are detected on a document
                  page.

                  * *KEY_VALUE_SET* - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for a field that's
                  detected on a document page. Use the ``EntityType`` field to determine if a
                  KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is any grid-based
                  information with 2 or more rows or columns with a cell span of 1 row and 1 column
                  each.

                  * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block
                  that contains the text in the cell.

                  * *SELECTION_ELEMENT* - A selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox
                  that's detected on a document page. Use the value of ``SelectionStatus`` to
                  determine the status of the selection element.

                - **Confidence** *(float) --*

                  The confidence that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy of the recognized text and
                  the accuracy of the geometry points around the recognized text.

                - **Text** *(string) --*

                  The word or line of text that's recognized by Amazon Textract.

                - **RowIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The row in which a table cell is located. The first row position is 1.
                  ``RowIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The column in which a table cell appears. The first column position is 1.
                  ``ColumnIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **RowSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of rows that a table spans. ``RowSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of columns that a table cell spans. ``ColumnSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **Geometry** *(dict) --*

                  The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes an axis-aligned,
                  coarse bounding box that surrounds the text, and a finer-grain polygon for more
                  accurate spatial information.

                  - **BoundingBox** *(dict) --*

                    An axis-aligned coarse representation of the location of the recognized text on
                    the document page.

                    - **Width** *(float) --*

                      The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page width.

                    - **Height** *(float) --*

                      The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page height.

                    - **Left** *(float) --*

                      The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      width.

                    - **Top** *(float) --*

                      The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      height.

                  - **Polygon** *(list) --*

                    Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around the recognized text.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values
                      returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the
                      input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=
                          0.5 and Y=0.25, then
                      the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.

                      An array of ``Point`` objects, ``Polygon`` , is returned by
                      DetectDocumentText . ``Polygon`` represents a fine-grained polygon around
                      detected text. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Textract
                      Developer Guide.

                      - **X** *(float) --*

                        The value of the X coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                      - **Y** *(float) --*

                        The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                - **Id** *(string) --*

                  The identifier for the recognized text. The identifier is only unique for a single
                  operation.

                - **Relationships** *(list) --*

                  A list of child blocks of the current block. For example a LINE object has child
                  blocks for each WORD block that's part of the line of text. There aren't
                  Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when
                  the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

                  * 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                  * 1 - The block has child blocks.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object
                    contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more
                    information, see  Block .

                    The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the
                    ``IDs`` array.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the
                      current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` .

                    - **Ids** *(list) --*

                      An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship
                      from the ``Type`` element.

                      - *(string) --*

                - **EntityTypes** *(list) --*

                  The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                  * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document.

                  * *VALUE* - The field text.

                   ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                   ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --*

                  The selection status of a selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox.

                - **Page** *(integer) --*

                  The page in which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous
                  operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multi-page documents
                  that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                  document pages, is always considered to be a single-page document and the value of
                  ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` as every input
                  document is considered to be a single-page document.

        """
        Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words
        that make up a line of text. The input document must be an image in JPG or PNG format.
        ``DetectDocumentText`` returns the detected text in an array of  Block objects.

        Each document page has as an associated ``Block`` of type PAGE. Each PAGE ``Block`` object
        is the parent of LINE ``Block`` objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page.
        A LINE ``Block`` object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are
        represented by ``Block`` objects of type WORD.

         ``DetectDocumentText`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use
         StartDocumentTextDetection .

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --*

              Metadata about the document. Contains the number of pages that are detected in the
              document.

              - **Pages** *(integer) --*

                The number of pages detected in the document.

            - **Blocks** *(list) --*

              An array of Block objects containing the text detected in the document.

              - *(dict) --*

                A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
                pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` depends on the
                type of operation. In document-text detection (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
                you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis
                (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields,
                tables and selection elements that are detected in the document.

                An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous
                operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of
                ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as
                GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

                For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__ .

                - **BlockType** *(string) --*

                  The type of text that's recognized in a block. In text-detection operations, the
                  following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child Block objects that are detected on a document
                  page.

                  * *KEY_VALUE_SET* - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for a field that's
                  detected on a document page. Use the ``EntityType`` field to determine if a
                  KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is any grid-based
                  information with 2 or more rows or columns with a cell span of 1 row and 1 column
                  each.

                  * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block
                  that contains the text in the cell.

                  * *SELECTION_ELEMENT* - A selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox
                  that's detected on a document page. Use the value of ``SelectionStatus`` to
                  determine the status of the selection element.

                - **Confidence** *(float) --*

                  The confidence that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy of the recognized text and
                  the accuracy of the geometry points around the recognized text.

                - **Text** *(string) --*

                  The word or line of text that's recognized by Amazon Textract.

                - **RowIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The row in which a table cell is located. The first row position is 1.
                  ``RowIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The column in which a table cell appears. The first column position is 1.
                  ``ColumnIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **RowSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of rows that a table spans. ``RowSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of columns that a table cell spans. ``ColumnSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **Geometry** *(dict) --*

                  The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes an axis-aligned,
                  coarse bounding box that surrounds the text, and a finer-grain polygon for more
                  accurate spatial information.

                  - **BoundingBox** *(dict) --*

                    An axis-aligned coarse representation of the location of the recognized text on
                    the document page.

                    - **Width** *(float) --*

                      The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page width.

                    - **Height** *(float) --*

                      The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page height.

                    - **Left** *(float) --*

                      The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      width.

                    - **Top** *(float) --*

                      The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      height.

                  - **Polygon** *(list) --*

                    Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around the recognized text.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values
                      returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the
                      input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=
                          0.5 and Y=0.25, then
                      the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.

                      An array of ``Point`` objects, ``Polygon`` , is returned by
                      DetectDocumentText . ``Polygon`` represents a fine-grained polygon around
                      detected text. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Textract
                      Developer Guide.

                      - **X** *(float) --*

                        The value of the X coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                      - **Y** *(float) --*

                        The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                - **Id** *(string) --*

                  The identifier for the recognized text. The identifier is only unique for a single
                  operation.

                - **Relationships** *(list) --*

                  A list of child blocks of the current block. For example a LINE object has child
                  blocks for each WORD block that's part of the line of text. There aren't
                  Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when
                  the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

                  * 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                  * 1 - The block has child blocks.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object
                    contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more
                    information, see  Block .

                    The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the
                    ``IDs`` array.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the
                      current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` .

                    - **Ids** *(list) --*

                      An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship
                      from the ``Type`` element.

                      - *(string) --*

                - **EntityTypes** *(list) --*

                  The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                  * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document.

                  * *VALUE* - The field text.

                   ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                   ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --*

                  The selection status of a selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox.

                - **Page** *(integer) --*

                  The page in which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous
                  operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multi-page documents
                  that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                  document pages, is always considered to be a single-page document and the value of
                  ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` as every input
                  document is considered to be a single-page document.

        Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes text in a
        document.

        You start asynchronous text analysis by calling  StartDocumentAnalysis , which returns a job
        identifier (``JobId`` ). When the text analysis operation finishes, Amazon Textract
        publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic
        that's registered in the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` . To get the results of
        the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS
        topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` , and pass the job identifier
        (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` .

         ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` returns an array of  Block objects. The following types of
         information are returned:

        * Words and lines that are related to nearby lines and words. The related information is
        returned in two  Block objects each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET`` : a KEY Block object and a
        VALUE Block object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and value.
        *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value.

        * Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected
        table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.

        * Selectable elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object
        contains information about a selectable element.

        * Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects.

        Use the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of blocks returned. If there are more
        results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation
        response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next
        page of results, call ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` , and populate the ``NextToken`` request
        parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
        ``GetDocumentAnalysis`` .

        :type JobId: string
        :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]**

          A unique identifier for the text-detection job. The ``JobId`` is returned from
          ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` .

        :type MaxResults: integer
        :param MaxResults:

          The maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value that you can
          specify is 1,000. If you specify a value greater than 1,000, a maximum of 1,000 results is
          returned. The default value is 1,000.

        :type NextToken: string
        :param NextToken:

          If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to retrieve),
          Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination
          token to retrieve the next set of blocks.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --*

              Information about a document that Amazon Textract processed. ``DocumentMetadata`` is
              returned in every page of paginated responses from an Amazon Textract video operation.

              - **Pages** *(integer) --*

                The number of pages detected in the document.

            - **JobStatus** *(string) --*

              The current status of the text detection job.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              If the response is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token. You can use this
              token in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of text detection results.

            - **Blocks** *(list) --*

              The results of the text analysis operation.

              - *(dict) --*

                A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
                pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` depends on the
                type of operation. In document-text detection (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
                you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis
                (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields,
                tables and selection elements that are detected in the document.

                An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous
                operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of
                ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as
                GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

                For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__ .

                - **BlockType** *(string) --*

                  The type of text that's recognized in a block. In text-detection operations, the
                  following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child Block objects that are detected on a document
                  page.

                  * *KEY_VALUE_SET* - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for a field that's
                  detected on a document page. Use the ``EntityType`` field to determine if a
                  KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is any grid-based
                  information with 2 or more rows or columns with a cell span of 1 row and 1 column
                  each.

                  * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block
                  that contains the text in the cell.

                  * *SELECTION_ELEMENT* - A selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox
                  that's detected on a document page. Use the value of ``SelectionStatus`` to
                  determine the status of the selection element.

                - **Confidence** *(float) --*

                  The confidence that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy of the recognized text and
                  the accuracy of the geometry points around the recognized text.

                - **Text** *(string) --*

                  The word or line of text that's recognized by Amazon Textract.

                - **RowIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The row in which a table cell is located. The first row position is 1.
                  ``RowIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The column in which a table cell appears. The first column position is 1.
                  ``ColumnIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **RowSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of rows that a table spans. ``RowSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of columns that a table cell spans. ``ColumnSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **Geometry** *(dict) --*

                  The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes an axis-aligned,
                  coarse bounding box that surrounds the text, and a finer-grain polygon for more
                  accurate spatial information.

                  - **BoundingBox** *(dict) --*

                    An axis-aligned coarse representation of the location of the recognized text on
                    the document page.

                    - **Width** *(float) --*

                      The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page width.

                    - **Height** *(float) --*

                      The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page height.

                    - **Left** *(float) --*

                      The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      width.

                    - **Top** *(float) --*

                      The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      height.

                  - **Polygon** *(list) --*

                    Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around the recognized text.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values
                      returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the
                      input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=
                          0.5 and Y=0.25, then
                      the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.

                      An array of ``Point`` objects, ``Polygon`` , is returned by
                      DetectDocumentText . ``Polygon`` represents a fine-grained polygon around
                      detected text. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Textract
                      Developer Guide.

                      - **X** *(float) --*

                        The value of the X coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                      - **Y** *(float) --*

                        The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                - **Id** *(string) --*

                  The identifier for the recognized text. The identifier is only unique for a single
                  operation.

                - **Relationships** *(list) --*

                  A list of child blocks of the current block. For example a LINE object has child
                  blocks for each WORD block that's part of the line of text. There aren't
                  Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when
                  the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

                  * 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                  * 1 - The block has child blocks.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object
                    contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more
                    information, see  Block .

                    The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the
                    ``IDs`` array.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the
                      current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` .

                    - **Ids** *(list) --*

                      An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship
                      from the ``Type`` element.

                      - *(string) --*

                - **EntityTypes** *(list) --*

                  The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                  * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document.

                  * *VALUE* - The field text.

                   ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                   ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --*

                  The selection status of a selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox.

                - **Page** *(integer) --*

                  The page in which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous
                  operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multi-page documents
                  that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                  document pages, is always considered to be a single-page document and the value of
                  ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` as every input
                  document is considered to be a single-page document.

            - **Warnings** *(list) --*

              A list of warnings that occurred during the document analysis operation.

              - *(dict) --*

                A warning about an issue that occurred during asynchronous text analysis (
                StartDocumentAnalysis ) or asynchronous document-text detection (
                StartDocumentTextDetection ).

                - **ErrorCode** *(string) --*

                  The error code for the warning.

                - **Pages** *(list) --*

                  A list of the pages that the warning applies to.

                  - *(integer) --*

            - **StatusMessage** *(string) --*

              The current status of an asynchronous document analysis operation.

        """
        Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that detects text in a
        document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of
        text.

        You start asynchronous text detection by calling  StartDocumentTextDetection , which returns
        a job identifier (``JobId`` ). When the text detection operation finishes, Amazon Textract
        publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic
        that's registered in the initial call to ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` . To get the results
        of the text-detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon
        SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If so, call ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` , and pass the job
        identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial call to ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` .

         ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` returns an array of  Block objects.

        Each document page has as an associated ``Block`` of type PAGE. Each PAGE ``Block`` object
        is the parent of LINE ``Block`` objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page.
        A LINE ``Block`` object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are
        represented by ``Block`` objects of type WORD.

        Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned. If there are
        more results than specified in ``MaxResults`` , the value of ``NextToken`` in the operation
        response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next
        page of results, call ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` , and populate the ``NextToken`` request
        parameter with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
        ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

        :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]**

          A unique identifier for the text detection job. The ``JobId`` is returned from
          ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` .

        :type MaxResults: integer
        :param MaxResults:

          The maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest value you can
          specify is 1,000. If you specify a value greater than 1,000, a maximum of 1,000 results is
          returned. The default value is 1,000.

        :type NextToken: string
        :param NextToken:

          If the previous response was incomplete (because there are more blocks to retrieve),
          Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination
          token to retrieve the next set of blocks.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --*

              Information about a document that Amazon Textract processed. ``DocumentMetadata`` is
              returned in every page of paginated responses from an Amazon Textract video operation.

              - **Pages** *(integer) --*

                The number of pages detected in the document.

            - **JobStatus** *(string) --*

              The current status of the text detection job.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              If the response is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token. You can use this
              token in the subsequent request to retrieve the next set of text-detection results.

            - **Blocks** *(list) --*

              The results of the text-detection operation.

              - *(dict) --*

                A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of
                pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` depends on the
                type of operation. In document-text detection (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
                you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis
                (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you can also get information about the fields,
                tables and selection elements that are detected in the document.

                An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous
                operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText , the array of
                ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as
                GetDocumentAnalysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

                For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__ .

                - **BlockType** *(string) --*

                  The type of text that's recognized in a block. In text-detection operations, the
                  following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

                  * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child Block objects that are detected on a document
                  page.

                  * *KEY_VALUE_SET* - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for a field that's
                  detected on a document page. Use the ``EntityType`` field to determine if a
                  KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                  * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic
                  Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that's detected on a
                  document page.

                  * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is any grid-based
                  information with 2 or more rows or columns with a cell span of 1 row and 1 column
                  each.

                  * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block
                  that contains the text in the cell.

                  * *SELECTION_ELEMENT* - A selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox
                  that's detected on a document page. Use the value of ``SelectionStatus`` to
                  determine the status of the selection element.

                - **Confidence** *(float) --*

                  The confidence that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy of the recognized text and
                  the accuracy of the geometry points around the recognized text.

                - **Text** *(string) --*

                  The word or line of text that's recognized by Amazon Textract.

                - **RowIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The row in which a table cell is located. The first row position is 1.
                  ``RowIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnIndex** *(integer) --*

                  The column in which a table cell appears. The first column position is 1.
                  ``ColumnIndex`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                  ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **RowSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of rows that a table spans. ``RowSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **ColumnSpan** *(integer) --*

                  The number of columns that a table cell spans. ``ColumnSpan`` isn't returned by
                  ``DetectDocumentText`` and ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                - **Geometry** *(dict) --*

                  The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes an axis-aligned,
                  coarse bounding box that surrounds the text, and a finer-grain polygon for more
                  accurate spatial information.

                  - **BoundingBox** *(dict) --*

                    An axis-aligned coarse representation of the location of the recognized text on
                    the document page.

                    - **Width** *(float) --*

                      The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page width.

                    - **Height** *(float) --*

                      The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page height.

                    - **Left** *(float) --*

                      The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      width.

                    - **Top** *(float) --*

                      The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document page
                      height.

                  - **Polygon** *(list) --*

                    Within the bounding box, a fine-grained polygon around the recognized text.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values
                      returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the
                      input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=
                          0.5 and Y=0.25, then
                      the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.

                      An array of ``Point`` objects, ``Polygon`` , is returned by
                      DetectDocumentText . ``Polygon`` represents a fine-grained polygon around
                      detected text. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Textract
                      Developer Guide.

                      - **X** *(float) --*

                        The value of the X coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                      - **Y** *(float) --*

                        The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon`` .

                - **Id** *(string) --*

                  The identifier for the recognized text. The identifier is only unique for a single
                  operation.

                - **Relationships** *(list) --*

                  A list of child blocks of the current block. For example a LINE object has child
                  blocks for each WORD block that's part of the line of text. There aren't
                  Relationship objects in the list for relationships that don't exist, such as when
                  the current block has no child blocks. The list size can be the following:

                  * 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                  * 1 - The block has child blocks.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Information about how blocks are related to each other. A ``Block`` object
                    contains 0 or more ``Relation`` objects in a list, ``Relationships`` . For more
                    information, see  Block .

                    The ``Type`` element provides the type of the relationship for all blocks in the
                    ``IDs`` array.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of relationship that the blocks in the IDs array have with the
                      current block. The relationship can be ``VALUE`` or ``CHILD`` .

                    - **Ids** *(list) --*

                      An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the relationship
                      from the ``Type`` element.

                      - *(string) --*

                - **EntityTypes** *(list) --*

                  The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                  * *KEY* - An identifier for a field on the document.

                  * *VALUE* - The field text.

                   ``EntityTypes`` isn't returned by ``DetectDocumentText`` and
                   ``GetDocumentTextDetection`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                - **SelectionStatus** *(string) --*

                  The selection status of a selectable element such as a radio button or checkbox.

                - **Page** *(integer) --*

                  The page in which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by asynchronous
                  operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multi-page documents
                  that are in PDF format. A scanned image (JPG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                  document pages, is always considered to be a single-page document and the value of
                  ``Page`` is always 1. Synchronous operations don't return ``Page`` as every input
                  document is considered to be a single-page document.

            - **Warnings** *(list) --*

              A list of warnings that occurred during the document text-detection operation.

              - *(dict) --*

                A warning about an issue that occurred during asynchronous text analysis (
                StartDocumentAnalysis ) or asynchronous document-text detection (
                StartDocumentTextDetection ).

                - **ErrorCode** *(string) --*

                  The error code for the warning.

                - **Pages** *(list) --*

                  A list of the pages that the warning applies to.

                  - *(integer) --*

            - **StatusMessage** *(string) --*

              The current status of an asynchronous document text-detection operation.

        Starts asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships between detected items
        such as key and value pairs, tables, and selection elements.

         ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` can analyze text in documents that are in JPG, PNG, and PDF
         format. The documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  DocumentLocation to specify
         the bucket name and file name of the document.

         ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ) that you use to get the
         results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a
         completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you
         specify in ``NotificationChannel`` . To get the results of the text analysis operation,
         first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If
         so, call  GetDocumentAnalysis , and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the initial
         call to ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` .

        :type FeatureTypes: list
        :param FeatureTypes: **[REQUIRED]**

          A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to return information
          about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to return detected
          fields and the associated text. To perform both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to
          ``FeatureTypes`` . All selectable elements (``SELECTION_ELEMENT`` ) that are detected are
          returned, whatever the value of ``FeatureTypes`` .

          The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request. If you use the same token
          with multiple ``StartDocumentAnalysis`` requests, the same ``JobId`` is returned. Use
          ``ClientRequestToken`` to prevent the same job from being accidentally started more than
          once.

        :param JobTag:

          An identifier you specify that's included in the completion notification that's published
          to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can use ``JobTag`` to identify the type of
          document, such as a tax form or a receipt, that the completion notification corresponds
          to.

        :type NotificationChannel: dict
        :param NotificationChannel:

          The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Textract to publish the completion status of
          the operation to.

        Starts the asynchronous detection of text in a document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of
        text and the words that make up a line of text.

         ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` can analyze text in documents that are in JPG, PNG, and PDF
         format. The documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  DocumentLocation to specify
         the bucket name and file name of the document.

         ``StartTextDetection`` returns a job identifier (``JobId`` ) that you use to get the
         results of the operation. When text detection is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a
         completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you
         specify in ``NotificationChannel`` . To get the results of the text detection operation,
         first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is ``SUCCEEDED`` . If
         so, call  GetDocumentTextDetection , and pass the job identifier (``JobId`` ) from the
         initial call to ``StartDocumentTextDetection`` .

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-detecting.html>`__ .
