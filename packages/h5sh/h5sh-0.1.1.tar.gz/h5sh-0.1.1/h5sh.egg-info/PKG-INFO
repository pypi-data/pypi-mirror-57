        Fast shell-like tool for interacting with HDF5 files.
        
        This tool is meant to replace repeated calls to ``h5ls`` and ``h5dump``, each
        of which can take substantial amounts of time for large files. In contrast,
        this utility only has to open a file once, doesn't have to read all the file
        contents in order to browse or view attributes, and uses HDF5's internal
        cacheing for speed.
        
        The ``h5sh`` tool uses a shell-like interface so that analysts will find the
        interface familiar.
