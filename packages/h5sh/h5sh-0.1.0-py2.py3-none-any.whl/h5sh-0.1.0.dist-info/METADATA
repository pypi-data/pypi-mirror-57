Fast shell-like tool for interacting with HDF5 files.

This tool is meant to replace repeated calls to ``h5ls`` and ``h5dump``, each
of which can take substantial amounts of time for large files. In contrast,
this utility only has to open a file once, doesn't have to read all the file
contents in order to browse or view attributes, and uses HDF5's internal
cacheing for speed.

The ``h5sh`` tool uses a shell-like interface so that analysts will find the
interface familiar.
