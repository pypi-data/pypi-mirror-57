# Better

This package extends other packages with functionality that users typically have to implement themselves. Better doesn't redefine or alter the initial implementations, simply adding additional utilites along side.

To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I am not suggesting that any initial implementation is substandard, nor that they were incomplete, far from it, I've used and enjoyed each package. This is a package of code snippets that I've written into various projects while using the respective package and thought that others might find them useful.
