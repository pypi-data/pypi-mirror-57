Description: ARPS: Framework to create and deploy Multi-Agents
        =====================
        
        ARPS is an acronym that comes from the simplest definition of an
        software agent is:
        
        * Autonomous: ability to run without human interaction
        
        * Reflexive: ability to act upon events
        
        * Proactive: ability to make its own decisions
        
        * Social: ability to interact with other agents to better achieve its
          objectives
        
        # Description
        
        ARPS is a framework to create Multi-Agent System (MAS). It provides a
        Discreve Event Simulation component for evaluation of the agents
        behaviour before deployment on a real environment.
        
        This framework does not impose any agent model for implementation.
