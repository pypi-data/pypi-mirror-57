# Educative Library: PyGANs

Simple Python Framework for creating GANs and seeing step by step the evolution of the generated data. Has an incorporated example that helps begginers to see the evolution of the GAN generating points in a 2D function.

Supported 2D Functions:
* Trigonometric Functions (f(x)=sin(x))  
*  Polynomial Functions, for example:  
O f(x) = x\*\*2  
O f(x) = x\*\*5 - 3x\*\*2 - 4
