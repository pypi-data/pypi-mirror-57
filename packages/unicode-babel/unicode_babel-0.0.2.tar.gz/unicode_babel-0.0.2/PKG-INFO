Description: # Unicode Babel
        
        Is a easy to use python package for generating random unicode characters.
        
        It's ideal for use in your tests or tools, Allowing you to quickly identify bugs and data processing issues.
        
        * Easy to use iterator for repeated tests
        * Unicode Planes 0 and 1 (...more coming soon)
        * Python 3.x
        * Free  to use and open source
        
        ## Getting started:
        
        This simple code:
        ```python
        from unicode_babel import tools, filters
        
        genny = tools.CodePointGenerator()
        
        for point in genny.random_codepoints(10, filters.filter_out_if_no_name)
            print(point)
        
        ```
        Will out put 10 random unicode code-points rom the Basic Multilingual Plane, filtered to ensure only valid named code-points are returned.:
        ```
        á“†
        á—¡
        ê‹›
        è²©
        Û…
        ä¶£
        æ¥¨
        èŸ·
        ä”‰
        Ý¥
        ```
        
        Or you can get individual codepoints and them use them with other tools, for example Selenium Webdriver:
        
        ```python
        from unicode_babel import tools, filters
        from selenium import webdriver
        from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
        
        browser = webdriver.Chrome()
        browser.get("https://www.google.com")
        
        data_genny = tools.CodePointGenerator()
        unusual_char = data_genny.get_random_codepoint(filters.filter_out_if_no_name)
        
        search_box = browser.find_element_by_name("q")
        search_box.send_keys(unusual_char + Keys.RETURN)
        
        ```
        Assuming you have Chromedriver in your path, that should open Google and search for a random character.
