# Django Dublin Core Resource

A Django model and admin interface to manage metadata about your resources
using [standard Dublin Core (DC) schema](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/).

The approach taken by this app is to centralise all your resource metadata
into a single table.

Most DC elements accepts only a single value to keep things simple.

# Data Models

* AbstractDublinCoreResource
  * an abstract Django Model that replicate the Dublin Core schema
  * each DC element is represented by a field
  * some DC terms are also included
  * makes use of ControlledTermField for links to controlled vocabularies
* DublinCoreResource
  * inherit from AbstractDublinCoreResource
* DublinCoreAgent
  * represents a person or organisation
* DublinCoreRights
  * represents Rights statements that can be shared among your resources

# Features
