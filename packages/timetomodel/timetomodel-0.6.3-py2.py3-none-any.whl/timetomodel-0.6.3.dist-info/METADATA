Sane handling of time series data for forecast modelling - with production usage in mind.
While modelling time series data with data science libraries like Pandas, statsmodels, sklearn etc.,
dealing with time series data is cumbersome - timetomodel takes some of that over. Loading data, making
train/test data, feeding data into rolling forecasts...
Also, the context and assumptions under which a model was made and used should not be in notebooks, they should
have a readable and reproducible spec.
Timetomodel is hopefully useful while doing data & model exploration as well as when integrating or replacing 
models in production environments.
