Description: A package to support resellers.
        
        It maintains in a postgres database information about providers,
        products (called articles),
        clients, orders and deliveries. It uses a Zope2 frontend
        for user interaction.
        
        It assumes a single (implicit) reseller
        and several "provider"s and "client"s.
        
        Each provider provides "article"s which the clients can buy.
        
        Clients buy articles in "unit"s; the provider provides them
        in "packet"s which contain an integral number of "unit"s. If
        the "packet_size" is different from 1, then the reseller repackages
        the delivered articles for its clients.
        
        The reseller continously collects "client_order_item"s and
        periodically issues "order"s to a provider consisting of
        "provider_order_item"s.
        
        The reseller occationally receives a "provider_delivery" for an order
        consisting of "provider_delivery_item"s and splits them into
        "client_delivery_item"s.
        
        There is a special client, used as stock. It can be used to
        balance orders and deliveries. It (and it alone) can have
        negative "unit" values in its "client_delivery_items" - indicating
        that units have been taken out of the stock.
        
        Usually, we do not delete items. Instead, we mark them as not "active".
        This is in order not to break references.
