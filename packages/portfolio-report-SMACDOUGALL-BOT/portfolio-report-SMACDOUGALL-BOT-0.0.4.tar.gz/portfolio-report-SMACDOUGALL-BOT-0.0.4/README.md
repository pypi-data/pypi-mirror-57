# Portfolio Report

------------

This program reads your stock portfolio from a list that includes symbols, units, and cost basis. It then looks up the
current price of the stocks using the symbols. Finally it calculates the book value and current market value using all of the 
information gathered and outputs a CSV showing gain/loss in a dollar amount and percentage.
