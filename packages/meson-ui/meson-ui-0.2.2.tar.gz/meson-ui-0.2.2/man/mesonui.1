.SH NAME
meson-ui - Meson-ui is a command line plug-in for Meson build system.
.SH DESCRIPTION

Meson-ui is a Graphical application designed to provide an interactive
way to use the Meson build system. We believe it is a nice way to get
CMake users comfortable with Meson.

The main design point of Meson-ui, is that developers should have a nice
build GUI that can be summed with one simple command and count on that
GUI to provide all or most of Meson build systems features.

Using Meson-ui is simple, all you need to do is run
this command:

.B meson-ui

.SH Basic version number
