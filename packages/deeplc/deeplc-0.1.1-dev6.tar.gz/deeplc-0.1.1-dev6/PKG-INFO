Description: DeepLC is a retention time predictor for (modified) peptides that employs Deep
        Learning. It’s strength lies in the fact that it can accurately predict
        retention times for modified peptides, even if hasn’t seen said modification
        during training.
        
        DeepLC can be run with a graphical user interface (GUI) or as a Python package.
        In the latter case, DeepLC can be used from the command line,
        or as a python module.
