Description: # PySpark CLI
        
        This will implement a PySpark Project boiler plate code based on user input.
        
        Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.
        
        PySpark is the Python API for Spark.
        
        ## Installation Steps:
            
            git clone https://github.com/qburst/PySparkCLI.git
        
            cd PySparkCLI
        
            pip3 install -e . --user
            
        ## Create a PySpark Project
            
            pysparkcli create [PROJECT_NAME] --master [MASTER_URL] --cores [NUMBER]
        
            master - The URL of the cluster it connects to. You can also use -m instead of --master.
            cores - You can also use -c instead of --cores.
                    
        ## Run a PySpark Project
            
            pysparkcli run [PROJECT_NAME]
            
        ## PySpark Project Test cases
            
           * Running by **Project name**
             
            pysparkcli test [PROJECT_NAME]
           * Running individual test case with filename: **test_etl_job.py**
           
            pysparkcli test [PROJECT_NAME] -t [etl_job]
