# topojson

topojson - a powerful library to encode geographic data as topology in Python!üåç
===============================================================================
**topojson** is a Python package with the aim of creating TopoJSON topology.

Main Features
-------------
  - Aims to create TopoJSON for _any_ geographic vector data parsed into Python
  - Ability to select the winding order of the geometric input.
  - Options to prequantize and presimplify the geometric features preparatory
    computing the topology.
  - Options to topoquantize and toposimplify after the topology is computed
  - Choose between the package `shapely` or `simplification` to simplify the
    linestrings or arcs.
  - Direct support to analyze the arcs as svg
  - Optional support to parse the TopoJSON into a GeoDataFrame if geopandas is
    installed.
  - Optional support to parse the TopoJSON directly into a mesh or geoshape in
    Altair if the package is installed.
  - Optional support for UI controls to exploring the results of topoquantize
    and toposimplify interactively if ipywidgets is installed.

# topojson.core.topology

## Topology
```python
Topology(self, data, topology=True, prequantize=True, topoquantize=False, presimplify=False, toposimplify=0.0001, simplify_with='shapely', simplify_algorithm='dp', winding_order='CW_CCW')
```

Returns a TopoJSON topology for the specified geometric object.
TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON providing multiple approaches
to compress the geographical input data. These options include
simplifying the linestrings or quantizing the coordinates but
foremost the computation of a topology.

Parameters
----------
data : _any_ geometric type
    Geometric data that should be converted into TopoJSON
topology : boolean
    Specifiy if the topology should be computed for deriving the
    TopoJSON.
    Default is True.
prequantize : boolean or int
    If the prequantization parameter is specified, the input geometry
    is quantized prior to computing the topology, the returned
    topology is quantized, and its arcs are delta-encoded.
    Quantization is recommended to improve the quality of the topology
    if the input geometry is messy (i.e., small floating point error
    means that adjacent boundaries do not have identical values);
    typical values are powers of ten, such as 1e4, 1e5 or 1e6.
    Default is True (which correspond to a quantize factor of 1e6).
topoquantize : boolean or int
    If the topoquantization parameter is specified, the input geometry
    is quantized after the topology is constructed. If the topology is
    already quantized this will be resolved first before the
    topoquantization is applied.
    Default is False.
presimplify : boolean or float
    Apply presimplify to remove unnecessary points from linestrings
    before the topology is constructed. This will simplify the input
    geometries.
    Default is False.
toposimplify : boolean or float
    Apply toposimplify to remove unnecessary points from arcs after
    the topology is constructed. This will simplify the constructed
    arcs without altering the topological relations. Sensible values
    are in the range of 0.0001 to 10.
    Defaults to 0.0001.
simplify_with : str
    Sets the package to use for simplifying (both pre- and
    toposimplify). Choose between `shapely` or `simplification`.
    Shapely adopts solely Douglas-Peucker and simplification both
    Douglas-Peucker and Visvalingam-Whyatt. The pacakge simplification
    is known to be quicker than shapely.
    Default is "shapely".
simplify_algorithm : str
    Choose between 'dp' and 'vw', for Douglas-Peucker or Visvalingam-
    Whyatt respectively. 'vw' will only be selected if `simplify_with`
    is set to `simplification`.
    Default is `dp`, since it still "produces the most accurate
    generalization" (Chi & Cheung, 2006).
winding_order : str
    Determines the winding order of the features in the output
    geometry. Choose between `CW_CCW` for clockwise orientation for
    outer rings and counter-clockwise for interior rings. Or `CCW_CW`
    for counter-clockwise for outer rings and clockwise for interior
    rings.
    Default is `CW_CCW`.

# topojson.core.extract

## Extract
```python
Extract(self, data, options={})
```

This class targets the following objectives:
1. Detection of geometrical type of the object
2. Extraction of linestrings from the object

The extract function is the first step in the topology computation.
The following sequence is adopted:
1. extract
2. join
3. cut
4. dedup
5. hashmap

Parameters
----------
data : Union[shapely.geometry.LineString, shapely.geometry.MultiLineString,
shapely.geometry.Polygon, shapely.geometry.MultiPolygon, shapely.geometry.Point,
shapely.geometry.MultiPoint, shapely.geometry.GeometryCollection, geojson.Feature,
geojson.FeatureCollection, geopandas.GeoDataFrame, geopandas.GeoSeries, dict, list]
    Different types of a geometry object, originating from shapely, geojson,
    geopandas and dictionary or list of objects that contain a __geo_interface__.

Returns
-------
dict
    object created including
    - new key: type
    - new key: linestrings
    - new key: bookkeeping_geoms
    - new key: objects

### extractor
```python
Extract.extractor(self, data)
```
"
Entry point for the class Extract.

The extract function is the first step in the topology computation.
The following sequence is adopted:
1. extract
2. join
3. cut
4. dedup
5. hashmap

Returns an object including two new properties:

* linestrings - linestrings extracted from the hash, of the form [start, end],
as shapely objects
* bookkeeping_geoms - record array storing index numbers of linestrings
used in each object.

For each line or polygon geometry in the input hash, including nested
geometries as in geometry collections, the `coordinates` array is replaced
with an equivalent `"coordinates"` array that points to one of the
linestrings as indexed in `bookkeeping_geoms`.

Points geometries are not collected within the new properties, but are placed
directly into the `"coordinates"` array within each object.

### serialize_geom_type
```python
Extract.serialize_geom_type(self, geom)
```

This function handles the different types that can occur within known
geographical data. Each type is registerd as its own function and called when
found, if none of the types match the input geom the current function is
executed.

The adoption of the dispatcher approach makes the usage of multiple if-else
statements not needed, since the dispatcher redirects the `geom` input to the
function which handles that partical geometry type.

The following geometry types are registered:
- shapely.geometry.LineString
- shapely.geometry.MultiLineString
- shapely.geometry.Polygon
- shapely.geometry.MultiPolygon
- shapely.geometry.Point
- shapely.geometry.MultiPoint
- shapely.geometry.GeometryCollection
- geojson.Feature
- geojson.FeatureCollection
- geopandas.GeoDataFrame
- geopandas.GeoSeries
- dict of objects that provide a __geo_interface__
- list of objects that provide a __geo_interface__
- object that provide a __geo_interface__
- TopoJSON string
- GeoJSON string

Any non-registered geometry wil return as an error that cannot be mapped.

Function that force a certain winding order on the resulting output geometries. One
can choose between "CCW_CW" and "CW_CCW".

"CW_CCW" implies clockwise for exterior polygons and counterclockwise for interior
polygons (aka the geographical right-hand-rule where the right hand is in the area
of interest as you walk the line).

"CCW_CW" implies counterclockwise for exterior polygons and clockwise for interior
polygons (aka the mathematical right-hand-rule where the right hand curls around
the polygon's exterior with your thumb pointing "up" (toward space), signing a
positive area for the polygon in the signed area sense).

TopoJSON, and so this package, defaults to "CW_CCW"*, but depending on the
application you might decide differently.

Only applies to Polygons and MultiPolygons.

Parameters
----------
geom : geometry or shapely.geometry.GeometryCollection
    Geometry objects where the winding order will be forced upon.
order : str, optional
    Choose "CW_CCW" for clockwise for exterior- and counterclockwise for
    interior polygons or "CCW_CW" for counterclockwise for exterior- and clockwise
    for interior polygons, by default "CW_CCW".

Returns
-------
geom : geometry or shapely.geometry.GeometryCollection
    Geometry objects where the chosen winding order is forced upon.

## round_coordinates
```python
round_coordinates(linestrings, rounding_precision)
```

Round all coordinates to a specified precision, e.g. rounding_precision=3 will round
to 3 decimals on the resulting output geometries (after the topology is computed).

Parameters
----------
linestrings: list of shapely.geometry.LineStrings
    LineStrings of which the coordinates will be rounded
rounding_precision : int
    Precision value. Up till how many decimales the coordinates should be rounded.

Returns
-------
linestrings: list of shapely.geometry.LineStrings
    LineStrings of which the coordinates will be rounded

## prettify
```python
prettify(topojson_object)
```

prettify TopoJSON Format output for readability.

Parameters
----------
topojson_object : topojson.Topojson
    [description]

Returns
-------
topojson_object : topojson.Topojson
    pretty printed JSON variant of the topoloy object

## properties_level
```python
properties_level(topojson_object, position='nested')
```

Define where the attributes of the geometry object should be placed. Choose between
"nested" or "foreign. Default is "nested" where the attribute information is placed
within the "properties" ditctionary, part of the geometry.
"foreign", tries to place the attributes on the same level as the geometry.

Parameters
----------
topojson_object : topojson.Topojson
    [description]
position : str, optional
    [description], by default "nested"

## delta_encoding
```python
delta_encoding(linestrings)
```

Function to apply delta-encoding to linestrings. Delta-encoding is a technique ..

Replace in Hashmapper class.

Parameters
----------
linestrings : list of shapely.geometry.LineStrings
    LineStrings that will be delta-encoded

Returns
-------
linestrings : list of shapely.geometry.LineStrings
    LineStrings that are delta-encoded
