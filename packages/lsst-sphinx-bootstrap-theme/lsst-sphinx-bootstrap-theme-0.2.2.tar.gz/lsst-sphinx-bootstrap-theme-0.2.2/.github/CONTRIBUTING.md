# Contributing to lsst-sphinx-bootstrap-theme

LSST DM Developers should use our normal [development workflow](https://developer.lsst.io/processes/workflow.html) for reporting issues.

External developers can raise a GitHub issue. Because this is still a young package, we're unlikely to accept pull requests. Feel free to create a GitHub issue with your ideas and suggestions.
