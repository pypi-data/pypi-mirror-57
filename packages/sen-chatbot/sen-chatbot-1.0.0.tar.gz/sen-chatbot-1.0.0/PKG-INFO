Description: # sen-chatbot
        Python Package for Chatbot
        
        >>> from ChatBot import ChatBot 
        # How to use
        >>> cb = ChatBot()
        >>> cb.reply('hi')      # gives reply based on the given string and data which is set
        'Hi there'                
        >>> cb.quickReply('hi') # same as reply(argument) but returns faster. Recommended in case of huge data. 
        'Hello'
        # In case of reply(argument) when any of the input strings is found to be a subset of the given argument then it will consider it and show anyone of the matching results randomly. In case of quickReply(argument) it will only show the result which is fully matching with the given argument and it returns a response immediately once it finds a match.
        
        # Adding Data
        >>> input_list = ['new user','do not have account']  
        >>> output_list = ['register','create one!']
        >>> cb.addData(input_list,output_list)       # Two lists must be passed as inputs and respective outputs.
        >>> cb.reply('new user')
        'register'
        # If any of the inputs matches with the argument of reply(argument) function then it returns a response among the outputs randomly.
        
        # Set or Reset Data
        >>> data = {'1':{'input':['hi','hello'],'output':['hello']},'2':{'input':['bye'],'output':['goodbye','tata']}}
        >>> cb.setData(data)    # The data should be in given dictionary format.
        >>> cb.showData()
        {'1': {'input': ['hi', 'hello'], 'output': ['hello']}, '2': {'input': ['bye'], 'output': ['goodbye', 'tata']}}    
        >>> cb.quickReply('bye')
        'tata'
        
        # In case of adding or setting data try to keep the proper format. Previously some data is set for basic use but we can customize it according to our needs.
        
        # Showing data
        >>> cb.showData()
        {'1': {'input': ['hi', 'hello'], 'output': ['hello', 'hi there']}, '2': {'input': ['bye'], 'output': ['goodbye', 'tata']}}
        
        # In case of setData(dict_data) you need to pass a dictionary in the above format.
