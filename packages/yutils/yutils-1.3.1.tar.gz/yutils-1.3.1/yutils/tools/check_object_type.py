    """
    This checks the types of an object using a certain syntax:
    Lets say we have an object_to_check and the types_to_validate.
    The object_to_check is the object

    :param object_to_check: the object you wish to check its type, and raise an exception should its type not be correct
    :type object_to_check: ....that's what we're here for....
    :param types_to_validate: defines the wanted types for the object to check:
    :type types_to_validate:
                type - checks that object_to_check is of that type
                        Example: float will make sure object_to_check is a float
                list of types - checks that object_to_check is one of the types in the list
                        Example: [int, float] will make sure object_to_check is either an int or a float
                tuple of types - checks hierarchically:
                                    checks that object_to_check is of the type of the first item,
                                    then checks that each item in object_to_check is of the type of the second item,
                                    etc.
                                 Remember, all types in the tuple except the last must support indexing.
                        Example: (list, str) will make sure object_to_check is a list of strings
                                 (tuple, [int, float]) will make sure object_to_check is a tuple of either ints or floats
                dict - checks that object_to_check is an object. It's type is defined by key 'type',
                       with other keys to be checked as the object's attributes.
                        Example: {'type': Person, 'age': int} will make sure object_to_check is a Person object,
                                 with an 'age' attribute that is an int.
                All values can have as many recursive dimensions as wanted.
    :param input_name: Do not use, this is for recursive inner use.

    More examples
    Lets say we create:

    integer = 13
    unicode_str = u'foo'
    int_list = list(range(10))
    input_object = MyObject()
    input_object.num = 3
    input_object.lis = [1, 'bar']
    input_object.3dlist = [[(1, 2, 3), (1, 1, 1)], [('a', 'b', 'c'), [7, 8, 9]]]

    We can send:
    check_object_type(integer, int)
    check_object_type(unicode_str, unicode)
    check_object_type(int_list, (list, int))
    check_object_type(input_object, {'type': MyObject,
                                     'num': int,
                                     'lis': (list, [int, str]),
                                     '3dlist': (list, list, [tuple, list], [int, str, unicode])
                                     })
