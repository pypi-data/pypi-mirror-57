                  Current status of the fleet.

                  Possible fleet statuses include the following:

                  * **NEW** -- A new fleet has been defined and desired instances is set to 1.

                  * **DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING** -- Amazon GameLift is setting up
                  the new fleet, creating new instances with the game build or Realtime script and
                  starting server processes.

                - **ServerLaunchPath** *(string) --*

                  Path to a game server executable in the fleet's build, specified for fleets
                  created before 2016-08-04 (or AWS SDK v. 0.12.16). Server launch paths for fleets
                  created after this date are specified in the fleet's  RuntimeConfiguration .

                - **ServerLaunchParameters** *(string) --*

                  Game server launch parameters specified for fleets created before 2016-08-04 (or
                  AWS SDK v. 0.12.16). Server launch parameters for fleets created after this date
                  are specified in the fleet's  RuntimeConfiguration .

                - **LogPaths** *(list) --*

                  Location of default log files. When a server process is shut down, Amazon GameLift
                  captures and stores any log files in this location. These logs are in addition to
                  game session logs; see more on game session logs in the `Amazon GameLift Developer
                  Guide
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-api-server-code>`__
                  . If no default log path for a fleet is specified, Amazon GameLift automatically
                  uploads logs that are stored on each instance at ``C:\\game\\logs`` (for Windows)
                  or ``/local/game/logs`` (for Linux). Use the Amazon GameLift console to access
                  stored logs.

                  - *(string) --*

                - **NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy** *(string) --*

                  Type of game session protection to set for all new instances started in the fleet.

                  * **NoProtection** -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down
                  event.

                  * **FullProtection** -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot
                  be terminated during a scale-down event.

                - **OperatingSystem** *(string) --*

                  Operating system of the fleet's computing resources. A fleet's operating system
                  depends on the OS specified for the build that is deployed on this fleet.

                - **ResourceCreationLimitPolicy** *(dict) --*

                  Fleet policy to limit the number of game sessions an individual player can create
                  over a span of time.

                  - **NewGameSessionsPerCreator** *(integer) --*

                    Maximum number of game sessions that an individual can create during the policy
                    period.

                  - **PolicyPeriodInMinutes** *(integer) --*

                    Time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit policy.

                - **MetricGroups** *(list) --*

                  Names of metric groups that this fleet is included in. In Amazon CloudWatch, you
                  can view metrics for an individual fleet or aggregated metrics for fleets that are
                  in a fleet metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a
                  time.

                  - *(string) --*

                - **StoppedActions** *(list) --*

                  List of fleet actions that have been suspended using  StopFleetActions . This
                  includes auto-scaling.

                  - *(string) --*

                - **InstanceRoleArn** *(string) --*

                  Unique identifier for an AWS IAM role that manages access to your AWS services.
                  With an instance role ARN set, any application that runs on an instance in this
                  fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, daemons
                  (background processes). Create a role or look up a role's ARN using the `IAM
                  dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`__ in the AWS Management Console.

              - *(dict) --*

                Information about the fleet's capacity. Fleet capacity is measured in EC2 instances.
                By default, new fleets have a capacity of one instance, but can be updated as
                needed. The maximum number of instances for a fleet is determined by the fleet's
                instance type.

                  Type of event being logged. The following events are currently in use:

                   **Fleet creation events:**

                  * FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet record was successfully created with a status of
                  ``NEW`` . Event messaging includes the fleet ID.

                  * FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from ``NEW`` to ``DOWNLOADING``
                  . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for
                  installation.

                  * FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet
                  instance.

                  * FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully
                  downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the
                  uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet
                  from moving to ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files
                  that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in
                  *PreSignedLogUrl* .

                  * FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully
                  extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if
                  one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ``ACTIVE``
                  status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the
                  install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in
                  *PreSignedLogUrl* .

                  * FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful,
                  and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which
                  are specified in the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch
                  path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for
                  the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to
                  ``ACTIVE`` status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the run-time
                  configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL
                  in *PreSignedLogUrl* .

                  * FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from ``DOWNLOADING`` to
                  ``VALIDATING`` .

                  * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time
                  configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not
                  exist on the instance.

                  * FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from ``VALIDATING`` to ``BUILDING``
                  .

                  * FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time
                  configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to
                  run on the fleet instance.

                  * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from ``BUILDING`` to
                  ``ACTIVATING`` .

                  * FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the
                  steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game
                  build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but
                  was not able to start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the
                  game server is not reporting "process ready" to the Amazon GameLift service.

                  * FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ``ACTIVATING`` to
                  ``ACTIVE`` . The fleet is now ready to host game sessions.

                   **VPC peering events:**

                  * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been established
                  between the VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.

                  * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event
                  details and status information (see  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide
                  additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have
                  overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block
                  for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see
                  `https\\://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>`__

                  * FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been successfully
                  deleted.

                   **Spot instance events:**

                  * INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute
                  notification.

                   **Other fleet events:**

                  * FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings
                  (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the
                  new capacity settings.

                  * FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to the
                  fleet's game session protection policy setting. Event messaging includes both the
                  old and new policy setting.

                  * FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

                  * GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

                - **Message** *(string) --*

                  Additional information related to the event.

                - **EventTime** *(datetime) --*

                  Time stamp indicating when this event occurred. Format is a number expressed in
                  Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

                - **PreSignedLogUrl** *(string) --*

                  - **StatusReason** *(string) --*

                    Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED``
                    indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was
                    reclaimed, causing the active game session to be terminated.

                  - **GameProperties** *(list) --*

                    Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These
                    properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a
                    request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__
                    ). You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with
                    SearchGameSessions .

                    - *(dict) --*

                      Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When
                      included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be
                      used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode,
                      level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when
                      initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as
                      appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide

                    an app needs both the IP address and port number.

                  - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --*

                    Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

                  - **CreatorId** *(string) --*

                    Unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection
                    policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can
                    create.

                  - **GameSessionData** *(string) --*

                    Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This
                    data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a
                    request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__
                    ).

                  - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --*

                    Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game
                    session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the
                    matchmaking configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the
                    match, including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on
                    matchmaker data, see `Match Data

                    . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated
                    whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see
                    StartMatchBackfill ).

                - **ProtectionPolicy** *(string) --*

                  Current status of protection for the game session.

                  * **NoProtection** -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down
                  event.

                  * **FullProtection** -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot

              Collection of objects that describes the requested game session queues.

              - *(dict) --*

                Configuration of a queue that is used to process game session placement requests.
                The queue configuration identifies several game features:

                * The destinations where a new game session can potentially be hosted. Amazon
                GameLift tries these destinations in an order based on either the queue's default
                order or player latency information, if provided in a placement request. With
                latency information, Amazon GameLift can place game sessions where the majority of
                players are reporting the lowest possible latency.

                * The length of time that placement requests can wait in the queue before timing
                out.

                * A set of optional latency policies that protect individual players from high
                latencies, preventing game sessions from being placed where any individual player is
                reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum.

                *  DeleteGameSessionQueue

                - **Name** *(string) --*

                  Descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be
                  unique within each region.

                - **GameSessionQueueArn** *(string) --*

                  Amazon Resource Name (`ARN
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__ ) that is
                  assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is
                  ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>:<aws account>:gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` .

                - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --*

                  Maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the
                  queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a
                  ``TIMED_OUT`` status.

                - **PlayerLatencyPolicies** *(list) --*

                  Collection of latency policies to apply when processing game sessions placement
                  requests with player latency information. Multiple policies are evaluated in order
                  of the maximum latency value, starting with the lowest latency values. With just
                  one policy, it is enforced at the start of the game session placement for the
                  duration period. With multiple policies, each policy is enforced consecutively for
                  its duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a 60-second policy
                  followed by a 120-second policy, and then no policy for the remainder of the
                  placement.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Queue setting that determines the highest latency allowed for individual players
                    when placing a game session. When a latency policy is in force, a game session
                    cannot be placed at any destination in a region where a player is reporting
                    latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are only enforced when the
                    placement request contains player latency information.

                    *  DeleteGameSessionQueue

                    - **MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds** *(integer) --*

                      The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All
                      policies must have a value set for this property.

                    - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --*

                      The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a
                      new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is
                      enforced until the queue times out.

                - **Destinations** *(list) --*

                  List of fleets that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the
                  queue. Fleets are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN.
                  Destinations are listed in default preference order.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Fleet designated in a game session queue. Requests for new game sessions in the
                    queue are fulfilled by starting a new game session on any destination configured
                    for a queue.

                  Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game
                  session.

                - **Status** *(string) --*

                  Current status of the game session. A game session must have an ``ACTIVE`` status
                  to have player sessions.

                - **StatusReason** *(string) --*

                  Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED``
                  indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed,
                  causing the active game session to be terminated.

                - **GameProperties** *(list) --*

                  Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These
                  properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a
                  request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When
                    included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be
                    used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode,
                    level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when
                    initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as
                    appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide

                      Game property value.

                - **IpAddress** *(string) --*

                  IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an
                  app needs both the IP address and port number.

                - **DnsName** *(string) --*

                - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --*

                  Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

                - **CreatorId** *(string) --*

                  Unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection
                  policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can
                  create.

                - **GameSessionData** *(string) --*

                  Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This
                  data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request
                  to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session

                - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --*

                  Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game
                  session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking
                  configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match,
                  including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker

                  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

                - **GameProperties** *(list) --*

                  Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These
                  properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a
                  request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__
                  ). This information is added to the new  GameSession object that is created for a
                  successful match.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When
                    included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be
                    used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode,
                    level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when
                    initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as
                    appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide

                  successful match.

                - **BackfillMode** *(string) --*

                  Method used to backfill game sessions created with this matchmaking configuration.
                  MANUAL indicates that the game makes backfill requests or does not use the match
                  backfill feature. AUTOMATIC indicates that GameLift creates  StartMatchBackfill
                  requests whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about

            Represents the returned data in response to a request action.

            - **RuleSets** *(list) --*

              Collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects.

              - *(dict) --*

                Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build your player
                matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the
                parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in
                MatchmakingConfiguration objects.

                A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information
                and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see `Build a FlexMatch Rule Set
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-rulesets.html>`__
                .

                * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and
                set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4
                match that requires all eight slots to be filled.

                * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player
                characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use
                a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values.
                For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level.

                * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match
                based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual
                players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require each player to
                meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role,
                or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an entire
                group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a
                certain role.

                * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of
                time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting
                players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait
                indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to
                increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

                  Collection of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string. Comments are not
                  allowed in JSON, but most elements support a description field.

                Properties describing a player session. Player session objects are created either by
                creating a player session for a specific game session, or as part of a game session
                placement. A player session represents either a player reservation for a game
                session (status ``RESERVED`` ) or actual player activity in a game session (status
                ``ACTIVE`` ). A player session object (including player data) is automatically
                passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is
                validated.

                When a player disconnects, the player session status changes to ``COMPLETED`` . Once
                the session ends, the player session object is retained for 30 days and then
                removed.

                    policy using the metric PercentAvailableGameSessions, the target value should be
                    the preferred size of the fleet's buffer (the percent of capacity that should be
                    idle and ready for new game sessions).

        :type FleetId: string
        :param FleetId:

          Unique identifier for a fleet to search for active game sessions. Each request must
          reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

        :type AliasId: string
        :param AliasId:

          Unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to search for active game
          sessions. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

        :type FilterExpression: string
        :param FilterExpression:

          String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is
          included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in
          ``ACTIVE`` status.

          A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the
          following:

          * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` ,
          ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` ,
          ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` .

          * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` ,
          ``>=`` .

          * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values
          (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and
          must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
          values can only be used with the comparators ``=
              `` and ``<>`` . For example, the following
          filter expression searches on ``gameSessionName`` : "``FilterExpression": "gameSessionName
          = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"`` .

          To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords ``AND`` ,
          ``OR`` , and ``NOT`` and parentheses as needed. For example: ``x AND y AND NOT z`` , ``NOT
          (x OR y)`` .

          Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence
          rules:

          * ``=`` , ``<>`` , ``<`` , ``>`` , ``<=`` , ``>=``

          * Parentheses

          * NOT

          * AND

          * OR

          For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players
          that have an open player slot: ``"maximumSessions>=10 AND
          hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`` .

        :type SortExpression: string
        :param SortExpression:

          Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the
          request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following
          elements:

          * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName`` ,
          ``gameSessionId`` , ``gameSessionProperties`` , ``maximumSessions`` ,
          ``creationTimeMillis`` , ``playerSessionCount`` , ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions`` .

          * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are ``ASC`` (ascending) and ``DESC`` (descending).

          For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first:
          ``"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`` . Results with a null value for the sort
          operand are returned at the end of the list.

        :type PaginationConfig: dict
        :param PaginationConfig:

          A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

          - **MaxItems** *(integer) --*

            The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than
            the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output
            that you can use to resume pagination.

          - **PageSize** *(integer) --*

            The size of each page.

          - **StartingToken** *(string) --*

            A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous
            response.

                Properties describing a game session.

                A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session ends, its
                status is set to ``TERMINATED`` .

                Once the session ends, the game session object is retained for 30 days. This means
                you can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game session logs are
                retained for 14 days.

                - **GameSessionId** *(string) --*

                  Unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN has the following
                  format: ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or
                  idempotency token>`` .

                - **Name** *(string) --*

                  Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not
                  need to be unique.

                - **FleetId** *(string) --*

                  Unique identifier for a fleet that the game session is running on.

                - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

                  Time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number
                  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

                - **TerminationTime** *(datetime) --*

                  Time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number
                  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057").

                - **CurrentPlayerSessionCount** *(integer) --*

                  Number of players currently in the game session.

                - **MaximumPlayerSessionCount** *(integer) --*

                  Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game
                  session.

                - **Status** *(string) --*

                  Current status of the game session. A game session must have an ``ACTIVE`` status
                  to have player sessions.

                - **StatusReason** *(string) --*

                  Provides additional information about game session status. ``INTERRUPTED``
                  indicates that the game session was hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed,
                  causing the active game session to be terminated.

                - **GameProperties** *(list) --*

                  Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These
                  properties are passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a
                  request to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__
                  ). You can search for active game sessions based on this custom data with
                  SearchGameSessions .

                  - *(dict) --*

                    Set of key-value pairs that contain information about a game session. When
                    included in a game session request, these properties communicate details to be
                    used when setting up the new game session, such as to specify a game mode,
                    level, or map. Game properties are passed to the game server process when
                    initiating a new game session; the server process uses the properties as
                    appropriate. For more information, see the `Amazon GameLift Developer Guide

                      Game property identifier.

                    - **Value** *(string) --*

                      Game property value.

                - **IpAddress** *(string) --*

                  IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an
                  app needs both the IP address and port number.

                - **DnsName** *(string) --*

                - **Port** *(integer) --*

                  Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift game server, an
                  app needs both the IP address and port number.

                - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --*

                  Indicates whether or not the game session is accepting new players.

                - **CreatorId** *(string) --*

                  Unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection
                  policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can
                  create.

                - **GameSessionData** *(string) --*

                  Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This
                  data is passed to a game server process in the  GameSession object with a request
                  to start a new game session (see `Start a Game Session
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__
                  ).

                - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --*

                  Information about the matchmaking process that was used to create the game
                  session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. In addition the matchmaking
                  configuration used, it contains data on all players assigned to the match,
                  including player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker
                  data, see `Match Data

                  . Matchmaker data is useful when requesting match backfills, and is updated
                  whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see
                  StartMatchBackfill ).
