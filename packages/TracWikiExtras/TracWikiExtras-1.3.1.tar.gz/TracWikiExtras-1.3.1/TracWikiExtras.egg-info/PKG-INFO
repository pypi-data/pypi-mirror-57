Description: 
                This Trac plugin extends the Trac Wiki by providing support for:
                 * Icons and smileys.
                 * HTML entities and other frequently used symbols.
                 * Highlighting attentional phrases.
                 * Coloring text.
                 * Visually appealing and modern looking text and image boxes.
                 * Transformation of UNC paths to "file://" links.
        
                The Fugue icon library is contained within this distribution for
                convenience (though installation time is taking a hit), which contains
                more than 3.000(!) icons in three sizes (small/medium/large).
        
                Use the wiki markup (|name|) or the Icon macro to show any icon in the
                library. When a glob pattern (* and ?) is part of the name, a preview
                of matching icons is displayed. This feature is very handy for finding
                and selecting an icon when a wiki page is being edited in side-by-side
                mode.
        
                Attentional phrases such as FIXME, TODO and DONE are highlighted to
                catch attention.
        
                Use the Color macro to decorate wiki text with colors.
        
                Use the box wiki processor -- and its variants rbox, newsbox and
                imagebox -- to insert appealing and eye-catching boxes on the web page.
        
                Following set of macros that can be used to provide a visual index of
                the markup:
                 * [[ShowEntities]]
                 * [[ShowIcons]]
                 * [[ShowPhrases]]
                 * [[ShowSmileys]]
                 * [[ShowSymbols]]
        
                Use the About-macros for instructions and demonstrations to wiki
                authors on some of these features:
                 * [[AboutWikiBoxes]]
                 * [[AboutWikiIcons]]
                 * [[AboutWikiPhrases]]
        
                The set of smileys, symbols and phrases, and the width of boxes are
                configurable.
