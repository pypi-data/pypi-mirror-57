# EDD Utils
This package is a utility for downloading Experiment Data Depot study instances through python or the commandline. It can be installed on your system through pip via the command

```console
pip install edd-utils
```

The package has two entry points, either as a commandline utility or as a python module. The commandline utility is used as below:

```console
$ export_study my_edd_study_slug --username my_edd_username --server my.edd.server.org
```

For an example of how to use the python module see the jupyter notebook in the notebooks directory.

Note: The progressbar functionality will run correctly on JupyterLab v0.35.6 with enabled jupyterlab-manager labextension, which can be installed by

```console
 jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```
