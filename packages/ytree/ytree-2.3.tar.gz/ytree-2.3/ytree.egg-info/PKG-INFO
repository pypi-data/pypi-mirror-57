        This is ytree, a [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) extension for
        working with merger tree data.
        
        Structure formation in cosmology proceeds in a hierarchical fashion,
        where dark matter halos grow via mergers with other halos. This type
        of evolution can be conceptualized as a tree, with small branches
        connecting to successively larger ones, and finally to the trunk. A
        merger tree describes the growth of halos in a cosmological
        simulation by linking a halo appearing in a given snapshot to its
        direct ancestors in a previous snapshot and its descendent in the next
        snapshot.
        
        Merger trees are computationally expensive to generate and a great
        number of codes exist for computing them. However, each of these codes
        saves the resulting data to a different format. `ytree` is Python
        package for reading and working with merger tree data from multiple
        formats. If you are already familiar with using
        [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) to analyze snapshots from
        cosmological simulations, then think of `ytree` as the `yt` of merger
        trees.
        
        To load a merger tree data set with `ytree` and print the masses of
        all the halos in a single tree, one could do:
        
        ```
        >>> import ytree
        >>> a = ytree.load('tree_0_0_0.dat')
        >>> my_tree = a[0]
        >>> print(my_tree['tree', 'mass'].to('Msun'))
        [6.57410072e+14 6.57410072e+14 6.53956835e+14 6.50071942e+14 ...
         2.60575540e+12 2.17122302e+12 2.17122302e+12] Msun
        ```
        
        A list of all currently supported formats can be found in the online
        [documentation](https://ytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Arbor.html#loading-merger-tree-data). If
        you would like to see support added for another format, we would be
        happy to work with you to make it happen. In principle, any type of
        tree-like data where an object has one or more ancestors and a single
        descendent can be supported.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ytree can be installed with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install ytree
        ```
        
        To get the development version, clone this repository and install like this:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ytree-project/ytree
        cd ytree
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Below is a notebook that demonstrates how to use ytree with merger tree data.  For
        more information, see the full [ytree documentation](https://ytree.readthedocs.io).
        
         * [Introduction](https://github.com/ytree-project/ytree/blob/master/doc/source/notebooks/Intro_to_ytree.ipynb)
        
        ## Sample Data
        
        Sampled data for all merger tree formats supported by ytree is available on the
        [yt Hub](https://girder.hub.yt/) in the
        [ytree data](https://girder.hub.yt/#collection/59835a1ee2a67400016a2cda) collection.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        ytree would be much better with your contribution!  As an extension of
        [the yt Project](https://yt-project.org/), we follow the yt
        [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#contributing).
