Description: # Strategy Editor SDK
        
        This repository contains an SDK for writing Python strategies for the margin application
        found at [margin.io]().
        
        This package is available for Python 3.6 or higher through pip
        ```
        pip install margin-strategy-sdk
        ```
        
        You can import all classes and functions in your strategy by calling
        ```
        from margin_strategy_sdk import *
        ```
        
        **Note: The SDK does not provide any functionalities but merely mimics margin's strategy 
        development interface. To actually run your strategy you need to start it from the margin 
        application.**
        
        The easiest way to start off your strategy implementation is by cloning the strategy
        template found at https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/strategy-template.
        
        Also check out the official strategies by margin at
        https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/official-strategies and community created strategies
        at https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/community-strategies.
