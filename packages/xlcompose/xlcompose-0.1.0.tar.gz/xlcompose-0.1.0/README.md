# xlcompose
A declarative API for composing spreadsheets from python that is built on
`xlsxwriter` and `pandas` and inspired by `bokeh`.

### Why use xlcompose?
`xlcompose` provides a sweet spot between pandas `to_excel` and the `xlsxwriter`
API.  If you've ever needed to export multiple dataframes to a spreadsheet
or apply custom formatting, then you know pandas isn't up to the task.

On the other hand, `xlsxwriter` provides a tremendous amount of customization,
but it's imperative style can often lead to very verbose code.

With `xlcompose`, Several components are provided
through a set of classes to allow for highly composible spreadsheets.

There are several classes that allow for the export of data from Python:
* `Series` - A class with formatting options for pandas Series
* `DataFrame` - A class with formatting options for pandas DataFrames
* `Image` - A class for exporting images
* `Title` - A convenience class around a Series for titling


Layout components include:
* `Row` - A class for laying out other components horizontally
* `Column` - A class for laying our other components vertically
* `CSpacer` - A class for adding spacing between components in a Column
* `RSpacer` - A class for adding spacing between components in a Row
* `Sheet` - A class for specifying sheet options
* `Tabs` - A class for laying out other components across sheets
