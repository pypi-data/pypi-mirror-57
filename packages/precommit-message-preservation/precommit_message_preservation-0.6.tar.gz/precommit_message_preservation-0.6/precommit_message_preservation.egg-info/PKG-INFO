Description: # precommit-message-perservation
        
        This is a simple library that makes it easier to code hooks for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) that validate commit messages that preserve the commit message on failure.
        In other words, if the user writes a long commit message and your pre-commit hook tells them the message is bad, they won't have their message entirely thrown away.
        
        ## Hacking
        
        You'll want to install the developer dependencies:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .[develop]
        ```
        
        This will include `nose2`, which is the test runner of choice. After you make modifications you can run tests with
        
        ```
        nose2
        ```
        
        When you're satisfied you'll want to update the version number and do build-and-upload:
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist
        twine upload dist/* --verbose
        ```
