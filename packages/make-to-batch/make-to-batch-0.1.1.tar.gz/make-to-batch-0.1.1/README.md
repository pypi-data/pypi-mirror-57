This is a simple tool to convert a GNU Makefile into a Windows Batch file.

## Usage

Install the tool by using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/make-to-batch/) using the following command:

```bash
pip install make-to-batch
```

You can also install by downloading the source code:

```bash
cd path/to/source/
python setup.py install
```

The tool provides only a command, `make-to-batch`, that converts a Makefile in the current directory to a batch file in the same directory. The tool behaviour can be customized using some options: here is the help of the tool.

```fundamental
$ make-to-batch -h
usage: make-to-batch [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT]
