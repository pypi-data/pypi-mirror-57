Description: # Linkchecker for Markdown-based static generated sites
        
        [![Actions Status](https://github.com/scivision/linkchecker-markdown/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scivision/linkchecker-markdown/actions)
        
        Python Requests-based simple check of links in Markdown .md files only.
        I got frustrated with all the false positives and moreso the false negatives from LinkChecker.py, which is also very slow and only works with HTML.
        This tool is very helpful for large Markdown-based Jekyll and Hugo sites.
        It is very fast and simple--it's what we use to check https://www.scivision.dev
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/scivision/linkchecker-markdown
        
        pip install -e linkchecker-markdown
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The static site generator does NOT have to be running for these tests--it looks at the .md files directly.
        Assuming your webpage Markdown files have top-level directory ~/web:
        
        * Jekyll
        
            ```sh
            python linkcheck.py ~/web/_posts
            ```
        
        * Hugo
        
            ```sh
            python linkcheck.py ~/web/content
            ```
        
        The `-v` `--verbose` options prints the URLs as they are checked.
        Observe that URLs from different markdown files are interleaved, showing the asynchronous nature of this program.
        
        ## Caveats
        
        Strict anti-leeching methods cause false positives with this and other link checking programs.
        The solution may be to use an asyncio-based web browser interface like Arsenic in this program, or simply use Go-based
