AlbaTraDIS is a software application for performing rapid large-scale comparative analysis of TraDIS experiments (transposon mutagenesis) whilst also predicting the impact of inserts on nearby genes. It allows for experiements with multiple conditions to be easily analysed using statistical methods developed in the Bio-TraDIS toolkit.
