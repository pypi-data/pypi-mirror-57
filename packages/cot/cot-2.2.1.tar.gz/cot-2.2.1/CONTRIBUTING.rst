Logging level usage
'''''''''''''''''''

COT uses logging levels (including the additional intermediate logging levels
provided by the `verboselogs`_ package) as follows:

Coding style
''''''''''''

We try to keep COT's code base compliant with Python coding standards including
`PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_. We use the flake8_ and Pylint_ tools and their
extension packages to verify this as part of our test automation.
To run coding style analysis independently of the other test automation, you
can run ``tox -e flake8,pylint``, or you can install these tools and run them
directly:

::

  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade flake8
  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade pydocstyle
  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade flake8-docstrings
  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade pep8-naming
  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade mccabe
  cot/$ flake8
  ./COT/ovf/item.py:229:1: C901 'OVFItem.value_replace_wildcards' is too complex (11)
  ./COT/ovf/item.py:603:1: C901 'OVFItem.generate_items' is too complex (11)
  ./COT/ovf/ovf.py:461:1: C901 'OVF.validate_hardware' is too complex (14)

::

  cot/$ sudo pip install --upgrade pylint
  cot/$ pylint COT
  ************* Module COT.ovf.item
  E:331,24: Instance of 'list' has no 'split' member (no-member)
  R:334,16: Redefinition of value type from list to tuple (redefined-variable-type)
  R:603, 4: Too many branches (13/12) (too-many-branches)
  ************* Module COT.ovf.ovf
  C:  1, 0: Too many lines in module (2646/2600) (too-many-lines)
  R:177, 0: Too many public methods (76/74) (too-many-public-methods)

Fix any errors and warnings these tools report, and run again until no errors are reported.

CLI consistency
'''''''''''''''

When adding or modifying CLI, keep the following guidelines in mind:

* All subcommands *must* support ``-h``/``--help``. Never redefine ``-h`` to
  mean something other than "get help".
* All commands that modify files *must* define ``-o``/``--output`` to specify
  a new file to create instead of overwriting any input file. If and only if
  the command does not modify the input file, you may use ``-o`` to mean
  something else (e.g., ``cot deploy ...`` has ``-o``/``--ovftool-args``).
* Best effort: use consistent argument names and short argument names unless
  there's an unavoidable conflict. Examples:

  * ``cot add-file`` and ``cot add-disk`` abbreviate ``--file-id`` as ``-f``,
    but ``cot remove-file`` abbreviates it as ``-i`` because it uses ``-f`` to
    mean ``--file-path``. In retrospect, using ``-p`` for ``--file-path``
    would have allowed COT to be more self-consistenct.
  * ``cot edit-hardware`` uses ``-p``/``--profiles`` to specify one or more
    configuration profiles to operate on. ``cot deploy esxi`` uses
    ``-c``/``--configuration`` to specify the configuration profile to deploy.
    In this case, this is somewhat unavoidable as ``cot edit-hardware`` uses
    ``-c`` to mean ``--cpus`` (no reasonable alternative) and
    ``cot deploy esxi`` uses ``-p`` to mean ``--password`` (likewise).

* In cases where short argument names unavoidably differ between commands,
  support the same set of long names if at all possible. For example,
  ``cot edit-hardware`` and ``cot deploy esxi`` should both support both
  ``--profile``\ (s) and ``--configuration``\ (s) as synonymous long names
  that can be used interchangeably to specify a configuration profile.

Add automated unit tests
------------------------

Whether adding new functionality or fixing a bug, **please** add appropriate
unit test case(s) under ``COT/tests/`` or  ``COT/<sub-package>/tests/``
(as appropriate) to cover your changes. Your changes **must** pass all existing
and new automated test cases before your code will be accepted.

You can run the COT automated tests under a single Python version by
running ``python ./setup.py test``.

For full testing under all supported versions as well as verifying code
coverage for your tests, you should install tox_ (``pip install tox``) and
coverage_ (``pip install coverage``) then run ``tox`` from the COT directory:
