PyUoI contains implementations of Union of Intersections framework for a variety
of penalized generalized linear models as well as dimensionality reductions
techniques such as column subset selection and non-negative matrix
factorization. In general, UoI is a statistical machine learning framework that
leverages two concepts in model inference:

1. Separating the selection and estimation problems to simultaneously achieve
   sparse models with low-bias and low-variance parameter estimates.
2. Stability to perturbations in both selection and estimation.


PyUoI is designed to function similarly to ``scikit-learn``, as it often builds
upon ``scikit-learn``'s implementations of the aforementioned algorithms.

Further details on the UoI framework can be found in the NeurIPS paper (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6708-union-of-intersections-uoi-for-interpretable-data-driven-discovery-and-prediction">Bouchard et al., 2017</a>).

# Installation

PyUoI is available for Python 3 on PyPI:

```
pip install pyuoi
```

and through conda-forge:

```
conda install pyuoi -c conda-forge
```

# Requirements

## Runtime

PyUoI requires

* numpy>=1.14
* h5py>=2.8
* scikit-learn>=0.20

and optionally

* pycasso
* mpi4py

to run.

## Develop

To develop PyUoI you will additionally need

* cython

to build from source and

* pytest
* flake8

to run the tests and check formatting.

# Features

PyUoI is split up into two modules, with the following UoI algorithms:

* `linear_model` (generalized linear models)
    * Lasso penalized linear regression UoI<sub>Lasso</sub>.
    * Elastic-net penalized linear regression (UoI<sub>ElasticNet</sub>).
    * Logistic regression (Bernoulli and multinomial) (UoI<sub>Logistic</sub>).
    * Poisson regression (UoI<sub>Poisson</sub>).
* `decomposition` (dimensionality reduction)
    * Column subset selection (UoI<sub>CSS</sub>).
    * Non-negative matrix factorization (UoI<sub>NMF</sub>).

Similar to `scikit-learn`, each UoI algorithm has its own Python class.
