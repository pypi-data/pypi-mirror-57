              An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load
              Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is
              an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID.

            - **Weight** *(integer) --*

              The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you
              configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you
              specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=
                  20).
              The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint,
              5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last
              endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights

              accelerators.

              If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the
              ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the

        :param TrafficDialPercentage:

          The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to
          other endpoint groups for this listener.

          Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific
          Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to
          the Region based on optimal routing.

          The default value is 100.

        :type HealthCheckPort: integer
        :param HealthCheckPort:

          The port that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part
          of this endpoint group. The default port is the listener port that this endpoint group is
          associated with. If listener port is a list of ports, Global Accelerator uses the first
          port in the list.

        :type HealthCheckProtocol: string
        :param HealthCheckProtocol:

          The protocol that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are
          part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

        :type HealthCheckPath: string
        :param HealthCheckPath:

          If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this specifies the path that is the destination for health
          check targets. The default value is slash (/).

        :type HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: integer
        :param HealthCheckIntervalSeconds:

          The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between each health check for an endpoint. The default
          value is 30.

        :type ThresholdCount: integer
        :param ThresholdCount:

          The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to
          unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

        :type IdempotencyToken: string
        :param IdempotencyToken: **[REQUIRED]**

          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency—that is,

                  - **HealthReason** *(string) --*

                    The reason code associated with why the endpoint is not healthy. If the endpoint
                    state is healthy, a reason code is not provided.

                    If the endpoint state is **unhealthy** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **Timeout** : The health check requests to the endpoint are timing out before
                    returning a status.

                    * **Failed** : The health check failed, for example because the endpoint
                    response was invalid (malformed).

                    If the endpoint state is **initial** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **ProvisioningInProgress** : The endpoint is in the process of being
                    provisioned.

                    * **InitialHealthChecking** : Global Accelerator is still setting up the minimum
                    number of health checks for the endpoint that are required to determine its
                    health status.

              - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --*

                The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is
                distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.

                Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific
                Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been
                routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

                The default value is 100.

              - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --*

                The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are
                part of this endpoint group.

                The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated
                with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified
                port in the list of ports.

              - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --*

                The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that
                are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

              - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --*

                If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global
                Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default
                is slash (/).

              - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --*

                The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The
                default value is 30.

              - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy
                endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value
                is 3.

          Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have
          stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Clienty
          affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific
          endpoint.

          AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal
          endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the
          "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address,
          destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best
          endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global
          Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the
          hash value changes.

          If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity
          to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses
          the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP
          address—to select the hash value.

          - *(dict) --*

            - **EndpointGroup** *(dict) --*

              The description of an endpoint group.

              - **EndpointGroupArn** *(string) --*

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              - **EndpointGroupRegion** *(string) --*

                The AWS Region that this endpoint group belongs.

              - **EndpointDescriptions** *(list) --*

                The list of endpoint objects.

                - *(dict) --*

                  A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more
                  endpoints, such as load balancers.

                  - **EndpointId** *(string) --*

                    An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or
                    Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
                    resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP
                    address allocation ID. An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or
                    internet-facing.

                  - **Weight** *(integer) --*

                    The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you
                    configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you
                    specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6
                    (sum=
                        20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the
                    first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20
                    is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint Weights
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__
                    in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                  - **HealthState** *(string) --*

                    The health status of the endpoint.

                  - **HealthReason** *(string) --*

                    The reason code associated with why the endpoint is not healthy. If the endpoint
                    state is healthy, a reason code is not provided.

                    If the endpoint state is **unhealthy** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **Timeout** : The health check requests to the endpoint are timing out before
                    returning a status.

                    * **Failed** : The health check failed, for example because the endpoint
                    response was invalid (malformed).

                    If the endpoint state is **initial** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **ProvisioningInProgress** : The endpoint is in the process of being
                    provisioned.

                    * **InitialHealthChecking** : Global Accelerator is still setting up the minimum
                    number of health checks for the endpoint that are required to determine its
                    health status.

                  - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --*

                    Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application
                    Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true
                    for new accelerators.

                    If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the
                    ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the
                    Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                    For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works-client-ip.html>`__
                    in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

              - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --*

                The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is
                distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.

                Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific
                Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been
                routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

                The default value is 100.

              - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --*

                The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are
                part of this endpoint group.

                The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated
                with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified
                port in the list of ports.

              - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --*

                The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that
                are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

              - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --*

                If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global
                Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default
                is slash (/).

              - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --*

                The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The
                default value is 30.

              - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy
                endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value
                is 3.

                The protocol for the connections from clients to the accelerator.

              - **ClientAffinity** *(string) --*

                Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if
                you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client
                request. Clienty affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client
                to the same specific endpoint.

                AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the
                optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global
                Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source
                port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash
                value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone
                uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not
                be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.

                If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client
                affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global
                Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address
                and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

                The default value is ``NONE`` .

          - *(dict) --*

            - **EndpointGroups** *(list) --*

              The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

              - *(dict) --*

                A complex type for the endpoint group. An AWS Region can have only one endpoint
                group for a specific listener.

                - **EndpointGroupArn** *(string) --*

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

                - **EndpointGroupRegion** *(string) --*

                  The AWS Region that this endpoint group belongs.

                - **EndpointDescriptions** *(list) --*

                  The list of endpoint objects.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or more
                    endpoints, such as load balancers.

                    - **EndpointId** *(string) --*

                      An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or
                      Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
                      resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP
                      address allocation ID. An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or
                      internet-facing.

                    - **Weight** *(integer) --*

                      The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints,
                      you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions
                      that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5,
                      and 6 (sum=
                          20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed
                      to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints,
                      and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint
                      Weights
                      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__
                      in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide* .

                    - **HealthState** *(string) --*

                      The health status of the endpoint.

                    - **HealthReason** *(string) --*

                      The reason code associated with why the endpoint is not healthy. If the
                      endpoint state is healthy, a reason code is not provided.

                      If the endpoint state is **unhealthy** , the reason code can be one of the
                      following values:

                      * **Timeout** : The health check requests to the endpoint are timing out
                      before returning a status.

                      * **Failed** : The health check failed, for example because the endpoint
                      response was invalid (malformed).

                      If the endpoint state is **initial** , the reason code can be one of the
                      following values:

                      * **ProvisioningInProgress** : The endpoint is in the process of being
                      provisioned.

                      * **InitialHealthChecking** : Global Accelerator is still setting up the
                      minimum number of health checks for the endpoint that are required to
                      determine its health status.

                    - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --*

                      Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application
                      Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true
                      for new accelerators.

                      If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the
                      ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the
                      Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                      For more information, see `Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global
                      Accelerator

                - **TrafficDialPercentage** *(float) --*

                  The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is
                  distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.

                  Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a
                  specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise
                  have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

                  The default value is 100.

                - **HealthCheckPort** *(integer) --*

                  The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that
                  are part of this endpoint group.

                  The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is
                  associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first
                  specified port in the list of ports.

                - **HealthCheckProtocol** *(string) --*

                  The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints
                  that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

                - **HealthCheckPath** *(string) --*

                  If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global
                  Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The
                  default is slash (/).

                - **HealthCheckIntervalSeconds** *(integer) --*

                  The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The
                  default value is 30.

                - **ThresholdCount** *(integer) --*

                  The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy
                  endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default
                  value is 3.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a previous call.

                      The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                      The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                - **Protocol** *(string) --*

                  The protocol for the connections from clients to the accelerator.

                - **ClientAffinity** *(string) --*

                  Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if
                  you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client
                  request. Clienty affinity gives you control over whether to always route each
                  client to the same specific endpoint.

                  AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the
                  optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global
                  Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source
                  port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash
                  value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone
                  uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not
                  be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.

                  If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client
                  affinity to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global
                  Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address
                  and destination IP address—to select the hash value.

                  The default value is ``NONE`` .

              The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you
              configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you
              specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=

              accelerators.

              If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the

        :param HealthCheckPort:

          The port that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part

        :type HealthCheckProtocol: string
        :param HealthCheckProtocol:

          The protocol that AWS Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are

                  - **HealthReason** *(string) --*

                    The reason code associated with why the endpoint is not healthy. If the endpoint
                    state is healthy, a reason code is not provided.

                    If the endpoint state is **unhealthy** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **Timeout** : The health check requests to the endpoint are timing out before
                    returning a status.

                    * **Failed** : The health check failed, for example because the endpoint
                    response was invalid (malformed).

                    If the endpoint state is **initial** , the reason code can be one of the
                    following values:

                    * **ProvisioningInProgress** : The endpoint is in the process of being
                    provisioned.

                    * **InitialHealthChecking** : Global Accelerator is still setting up the minimum
                    number of health checks for the endpoint that are required to determine its
                    health status.

                The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated
                with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified
                port in the list of ports.

          stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request. Clienty
          affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific
          endpoint.

          AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal
          endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is ``NONE`` , Global Accelerator uses the
          "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address,
          destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best
          endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global
          Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the
          hash value changes.

          If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity
          to ``SOURCE_IP`` instead. When you use the ``SOURCE_IP`` setting, Global Accelerator uses
          the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP
          address—to select the hash value.

          The default value is ``NONE`` .
