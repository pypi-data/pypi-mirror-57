# vendoring

CLI tool for making vendoring dependencies in Python projects easier

## Why?

pip had a home-grown setup for vendoring dependencies and it has grown a lot in complexity over time.

This tool was built by moving the dependency vendoring logic, into a dedicated codebase. This allows for independent evolution of this codebase and better infrastructure to ensure it's working properly.
