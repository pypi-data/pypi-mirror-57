          The name for the container. The name must be from 1 to 255 characters. Container names
          must be unique to your AWS account within a specific region. As an example, you could
          create a container named ``movies`` in every region, as long as you donâ€™t have an existing
          container with that name.

        :type Tags: list

          An array of key:value pairs that you define. These values can be anything that you want.
          Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value
          represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or
          "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container. For more information about
          tagging, including naming and usage conventions, see `Tagging Resources in MediaStore
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/tagging.html>`__ .

          - *(dict) --*

            A collection of tags associated with a container. Each tag consists of a key:value pair,
            which can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as
            "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such
            as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container.

            - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a
              category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a

              ContainerARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the newly created container. The ARN
              has the following format: arn:aws:<region>:<account that owns this
              container>:container/<name of container>. For example:
              arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/movies

              ContainerName: The container name as specified in the request.

              CreationTime: Unix time stamp.

              Status: The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of the
              following: ``CREATING`` , ``ACTIVE`` , or ``DELETING`` . While the service is creating
              the container, the status is ``CREATING`` . When an endpoint is available, the status
              changes to ``ACTIVE`` .

              The return value does not include the container's endpoint. To make downstream
              requests, you must obtain this value by using  DescribeContainer or  ListContainers .

              - **Endpoint** *(string) --*

                The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify the specific
                container when sending requests to the data plane. The service assigns this value
                when the container is created. Once the value has been assigned, it does not change.

              - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

                Unix timestamp.

              - **ARN** *(string) --*

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has the following format:

                arn:aws:<region>:<account that owns this container>:container/<name of container>

                For example: arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/movies

              - **Name** *(string) --*

                The name of the container.

              - **Status** *(string) --*

                The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of the following:
                ``CREATING`` , ``ACTIVE`` , or ``DELETING`` . While the service is creating the
                container, the status is ``CREATING`` . When the endpoint is available, the status
                changes to ``ACTIVE`` .

              - **AccessLoggingEnabled** *(boolean) --*

                The state of access logging on the container. This value is ``false`` by default,
                indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore does not send access logs to Amazon
                CloudWatch Logs. When you enable access logging on the container, MediaStore changes
                this value to ``true`` , indicating that the service delivers access logs for
                objects stored in that container to CloudWatch Logs.

                  The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify the specific
                  container when sending requests to the data plane. The service assigns this value
                  when the container is created. Once the value has been assigned, it does not

                  The state of access logging on the container. This value is ``false`` by default,

                  CloudWatch Logs. When you enable access logging on the container, MediaStore
                  changes this value to ``true`` , indicating that the service delivers access logs

               ``NextToken`` is the token to use in the next call to ``ListContainers`` . This token

          An array of key:value pairs that you want to add to the container. You need to specify
          only the tags that you want to add or update. For example, suppose a container already has
          two tags (customer:CompanyA and priority:High). You want to change the priority tag and
          also add a third tag (type:Contract). For TagResource, you specify the following tags:
          priority:Medium, type:Contract. The result is that your container has three tags:
          customer:CompanyA, priority:Medium, and type:Contract.

          - *(dict) --*

            A collection of tags associated with a container. Each tag consists of a key:value pair,
            which can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as
            "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such
            as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container.

              Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a
              category of information, such as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a
              specific value within a category, such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are
              case-sensitive.
