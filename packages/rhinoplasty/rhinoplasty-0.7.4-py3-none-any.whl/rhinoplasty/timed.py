    """Decorator to limit how long a test will run for.
    
    Caution: This decorator guarantees that the target function will return
    within the specified time limit (or thereabouts). However, if it does not
    complete in time, it will continue to run in a "zombie" background thread.
    Most of the time this will be acceptable, but if you need finer control
    over the lifecycle of your function, then consider a more explicit method
    of controlling it's execution (or else just deal with it running overtime).
    You might want to consider:
     * What will happen to the test fixture if you tear it down while the test
        is still running?
     * What will happen to the test function if it's test fixture gets torn
        down while it is still running?
     * What will happen to other test functions if this test is still
        running when they run?
    
    @param max_time: The maximum number of seconds the test is allowed to run
        for.
    @raise TimeExpired If the test runs too long. Nose will treat this as a
        test failure, rather than an error.
    @see nose.tools.timed for an alternative approach. The difference is that
        this decorator will not allow the test function to run any longer than
        the specified time limit, whereas Nose's version will wait until the
        test function finishes (however long that takes) before failing.
