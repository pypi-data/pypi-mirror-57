        Pronounced like 'p' + 'isle'.
        
        An interface to a pronunciation dictionary with stress markings
        (ISLEX - the international speech lexicon), 
        along with some tools for working with comparing and aligning 
        pronunciations (e.g. a list of phones someone said versus a standard or 
        canonical dictionary pronunciation).

        Common Use Cases
        ================
        
        What can you do with this library?
        
        - look up the list of phones and syllables for canonical pronunciations 
          of a word::
          
            pysle.isletool.LexicalTool.lookup('cat')
        
        - map an actual pronunciation to a dictionary pronunciation (can be used 
          to automatically find speech errors)::
          
            pysle.pronunciationtools.findClosestPronunciation(isleDict, 'cat', ['k', 'æ',])
        
        - automatically syllabify a praat textgrid containing words and phones 
          (e.g. force-aligned text) -- requires my 
          `praatIO <https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO>`_ library::
          
            pysle.syllabifyTextgrid(isleDict, praatioTextgrid, "words", "phones")
        
        - search for words based on pronunciation::
        
            e.g. Words that start with a sound, or have a sound word medially, or 
            in stressed vowel position, etc.

        Requirements
        ================
        
        - Before you use this library (before or after installing it) you will need
          to download the ILSEX dictionary.  It can be downloaded here under the
          section 'English' linked under the text 'English Pronlex'
          (with a file name of ISLEdict.txt):
        
          `ISLEX project page <http://isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/g2ps/>`_
        
          `Direct link to the ISLEX file used in this project
          <http://isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/g2ps/English/ISLEdict.txt>`_ (ISLEdict.txt)
        
        - ``Python 2.7.*`` or above
        
        - ``Python 3.3.*`` or above (or below, probably)
        
        - The `praatIO <https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO>`_ library is required IF 
          you want to use the textgrid functionality.  It is not required 
          for normal use.
        
        
        Installation
        ================
        
        If you on Windows, you can use the installer found here (check that it is up to date though)
        `Windows installer <http://www.timmahrt.com/python_installers>`_
        
        Psyle is on pypi and can be installed or upgraded from the command-line shell with pip like so::
        
            python -m pip install psyle --upgrade
        
        Otherwise, to manually install, after downloading the source from github, from a command-line shell, navigate to the directory containing setup.py and type::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If python is not in your path, you'll need to enter the full path e.g.::
        
        	C:\Python36\python.exe setup.py install
        
        	
        Example usage
        ================
        
        Here is a typical common usage::
        
            from pysle import isle
            isleDict = isle.LexicalTool('C:\islev2.dict')
            print isleDict.lookup('catatonic')[0] # Get the first pronunciation
            >> [['k', 'ˌæ'], ['t˺', 'ə'], ['t', 'ˈɑ'], ['n', 'ɪ', 'k']] [2, 0]
        
        and another::
        
            from pysle import isle
            from psyle import pronunciationTools
            
            searchWord = 'another'
            anotherPhoneList = ['n', '@', 'th', 'r'] # Actually produced (ASCII or IPA ok here)
        
            returnList = pronunciationTools.findBestSyllabification(isleDict, 
                                                                    searchWord, 
                                                                    anotherPhoneList)
            print syllableList
            >> [["''"], ['n', '@'], ['th', 'r']]
            
        
        Please see \\examples for example usage
