        ## [Reminders](#etm)
        
        *etm* offers a simple way to manage your events, tasks and other reminders. 
        
        Rather than filling out fields in a form to create or edit reminders, a simple text-based format is used. Each reminder in *etm* begins with a *type character* followed by a brief *summary* of the item and then, perhaps, by one or more *@key value* pairs to specify other attributes of the reminder. Mnemonics are used to make the keys easy to remember, e.g, @s for starting datetime, @l for location, @d for description and so forth.
        
        There are 4 types of reminders and associated *type characters*: task (**-**),event (**\***), record (**%**) and inbox (**!**). 
        
        ### examples
        
        * A task (**-**): pick up milk. 
        
        		- pick up milk
        * An event (**\***): lunch with Burk [s]tarting next Tuesday at 12pm and [e]xtending for 90 minutes, i.e., lasting from 12pm until 1:30pm.
        
                * Lunch with Burk @s tue 12p @e 90m
        * A record (**%**): a favorite Churchill quotation that you heard at 2pm today with the quote itself as the [d]escription.
        
                % Give me a pig - Churchill @s 2p @d Dogs look up at you. Cats look 
                  down at you. Give me a pig - they look you in the eye and treat you
                  as an equal.
        * A task (**-**): build a dog house, with component [j]obs.
        
        		- Build dog house @j pick up materials @j cut pieces @j assemble
        		  @j sand @j paint
        * Inbox (**!**): meet Alex for coffee Friday. This can be changed to an event when the time is confirmed by replacing the **!** with an **\***.
        
                ! Coffee with Alex @s fri ? @e 1h

        While the views differ in many respects, they also share some common aspects:
        
        * Press “N” in any view to create a new item.
        * Select a reminder by clicking on it or by using the up and down cursor keys to move the cursor to the line displaying the reminder. 
        * With a reminder selected:
            * Press “return” to toggle displaying the details. 
            * Pressing “E” to edit.  Then press “Ctrl-S” to save your changes and end  editing or “Ctrl-C” to end editing without saving your changes.
            * Press “C” to open a copy as a new reminder for editing.
            * Press “D” to delete.
            * Press “R” to reschedule the starting datetime.
            * Press “S” to schedule a new datetime instance.
            * For an item with an @g “goto” link, press “Ctrl-G” to open the link.
            * For an item that repeats, press “Ctrl-R” to show repetitions.
            * Timers
                * Press “t” to start a timer for the reminder.
                * With a timer active, press “t” to toggle paused/running.
                * Press “T” to record an  `@u usedtime`  entry in the reminder and close the timer.
        * Movement
            * Press page up or page down to shift the display a page at a time. 
            * Press “l”  (lower case L) and enter a number to move the cursor to a particular line  number. 
            * In the weekly views a),  b) and c), press “g” and enter a date to display the week containing the date.
            * In the dated views a), b), c), u), U) and y), press the right or left cursor keys to go  to the next or previous period, respectively, and the space bar to return to the current period.
        * Search.
            * Press “/“ (forward slash) and enter an expression to search the view for an item whose summary contains (case insensitive) the expression. 
            * After entering the search expression, press “n” to search  forward  (cyclically)  for other matches.

        Etm offers several conveniences when creating or modifying an item.
        
        * Fuzzy parsing of dates and date times. Supposing it is currently Wed, Feb 13 2019:
            * `@s 2` would be interpreted as the date Feb 2, 2019.
            * `@s 2p` would be interpreted as the datetime 2pm on Wed Feb 13 in the local timezone.
            * `@s 2p fri` would be interpreted as the datetime 2pm Fri, Feb 15 in the local timezone.
            * `@s 2p fri @z US/Pacific` would be interpreted as the datetime 2pm Fri, Feb 15 in the Pacific timezone but would be displayed as the corresponding time in the local timezone.
            * `@s 2p fri @z float` would be interpreted as the naive datetime 2pm Fri, Feb 15 and would be displayed as such in whatever happens to be the local timezone.
        * Automatic tab completion for elements you have used before including @z (timezone), @c (calendar), @t (tags), @i (index), @l (location), @n (attendees) and @x (expansion). E.g. when entering @z, you can choose from any timezone you have previously used. 
        
        # [Details](#etm)
        
        ## [Installation/Deinstallation](#etm)
        
        ### [Installation](#etm)
        
        <!--  [![etm: installing etm in a virtual environment](http://img.youtube.com/vi/fEPPG82AH7M/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEPPG82AH7M "installing etm in a virtual environment") -->
        
        Setting up a virtual environment for etm is recommended. The steps for OS/X or linux are illustrated below. For details see [python-virtual-environments-a-primer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Frealpython.com%2Fpython-virtual-environments-a-primer%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFh7QpJQ4rPCDjZ1eLrV1BRCCpSmw).
        
        Open a terminal and begin by creating a new directory/folder, say `etm-pypi` in your home directory, for the virtual environment:
        
                $ mkdir ~/etm-pypi
                $ cd ~/etm-pypi
        Now continue by creating the virtual environment (python >= 3.6 is required):
        
                $ python3 -m venv env
        After a few seconds you will have an `./env` directory. Now activate the virtual environment:
        
                $ source env/bin/activate
        The prompt will now change to something containing `(env)` to indicate that the virtual environment is active. Updating pip is now recommended:
        
                (env) $ pip install -U pip
        Note that this invokes `./env/bin/pip`. Once this is finished, use pip to install etm:
        
                (env) $ pip install -U etm-dgraham
        This will install etm and all its requirements in `./env/lib/python3.x/sitepackages` and will also install an executable called `etm` in `./env/bin`.
        
        By the way, the suggested terminal size for etm is 60 (columns) by 32 or more (rows). The default color scheme is best with a dark terminal background. A scheme better suited to light backgrounds can be set in `cfg.yaml`.
        
        Before you start etm, think about where you would like to keep your personal data and configuration files. The default is to use whatever directory you created for your virtual environment as your etm *home* directory. If this is not what you want, you can just give the path for whatever directory you would like to use when you start etm, e.g.,
        
                (env) $ etm ~/Documents/etm
        
        Considerations:
        
        * If more than one person will be using etm on the same computer, you might want to have different *home* directories for each user.
        * If you want to use etm on  more than one computer and use Dropbox, you might want to use `~/Dropbox/etm` to have access on each of your computers.
        
        Whatever *home* directory you choose, running etm for the first time will add the following to that folder.
        
                etm home directory/
                    backups/
                    logs/
                    cfg.yaml
                    db.json
        Here `cfg.yaml` is your user configuration file and `db.json` contains all your etm reminders. The folders `backups/` and `logs/` contain, respectively, the 5 most recent daily backups of your `db.json` and `cfg.yaml` files. The folder `logs` contains the current `etm.log` file and the 5 most recent daily backus.
        
        The file `cfg.yaml` can be edited and the options are documented in the file.
        
        ### [Deinstallation](#etm)
        
        If you should ever want to deinstall etm, first deactivate the virtual environment, if necessary, by changing to the virtual environment directory and entering
        
                (env) $ deactivate
        
        You can now simply delete the virtual environment directory and, if you have additional *home* directories, by deleting each of them. One of the many advantages of the virtual environment is that all installations are local to that environment and removing the directory, removes every trace.
        
        ## [Item Types](#etm)
        
        ### [event](#etm)
        
        Type character: **\***
        
        An event is something that happens at a particular date or datetime without any action from the user. Christmas, for example, is an event that happens whether or not the user does anything about it.
        
        
        - The `@s` entry is required and can be specified either as a date or as a datetime. It is interpreted as the starting date or datetime of the event. 
        - If `@s` is a date, the event is regarded as an *occasion* or *all-day* event. Such occasions are displayed first on the relevant date. 
        - If `@s` is a datetime, an `@e` entry is allowed and is interpreted as the extent or duration of the event - the end of the event is then given implicitly by starting datetime plus the extent and this period is treated as busy time. 
        
        Corresponds to VEVENT in the vcalendar specification.
        
        ### [task](#etm)
        
        Type character: **-**
        
        A task is something that requires action from the user and lasts, so to speak, until the task is completed and marked finished. Filing a tax return, for example, is a task. 
        
        - The `@s` entry is optional and, if given, is interpreted as the date or datetime at which the task is due. 
            - Tasks with an `@s` datetime entry are regarded as pastdue after the datetime and are displayed in *Agenda View* on the relevant date according to the starting time. 
            - Tasks with `@s` date entry are regarded as pastdue after the due date and are displayed in *Agenda View* on the due date before all items with datetimes.
            - Tasks that are pastdue are also displayed in *Agenda View* on the current date using the type character `<` with an indication of the number of days that the task is past due.
        - Tasks without an `@s` entry are to be completed when possible and are sometimes called *todos*. They are regarded as *next* items in the *Getting Things Done* terminology and are displayed in *Do Next* view grouped by @l (location/context).
        - Jobs
            - Tasks, both with and without @s entries can have component jobs using @j entries.  
            - For tasks with an @s entry, jobs can have an &s entry to set the due date/datetime for the job. It is entered as a timeperiod relative to  the starting datetime (+ before or - after) for the task. Zero minutes is the default when &s is not entered.
            - For tasks with an @s entry, jobs can also have &a, alert, and &b, beginning soon, notices. The entry for &a is given as a time period relative to &s (+ before or - after) and the entry for &b is a positive integer number of days before the starting date/time to begin displaying "beginning soon" notices. The entry for @s in the task becomes the default for &s in each job.  E.g., with
        
                    - beginning soon example @s 1/30/2018
                        @j job A &s 5d &b 10
                        @j job B &b 5
        
                Beginning soon notices would begin on Jan 15 for job A (due Jan 25) and on January 25 for job B (due Jan 30).
            - Prerequisites
                - Automatically assigned. The default is to suppose that jobs must be completed sequentially in the order in which they are listed. E.g., with
        
                        - automatically assigned
                            @j job A
                            @j job B
                            @j job C
                            @j job D
        
                    `job A` has no prerequisites but is a prerequisite for `job B` which, in turn, is a prerequisite for `job C` which, finally, is a prerequisite for `job D`. 
                - Manually assigned.  Job prequisites can also be assigned manually using entries for `&i` (id) and `&p`, (comma separated list of ids of immediate prequisites). E.g., with
        
                        - manually assigned
                            @j job a &i a
                            @j job b &i b &p a
                            @j job c &i c &p a
                            @j job d &i d &p b, c
        
                    `job a` has no prequisites but is a prerequisite for both `job b` and `job c` which are both prerequisites for `job d`. The order in which the jobs are listed is irrelevant in this case. 
            - Tasks with jobs are displayed by job using a combination of the task and job summaries with a type character indicating the status of the job. E.g.,  
        
                    ✓ manually assigned [2/1/1]: job a
                    - manually assigned [2/1/1]: job b
                    - manually assigned [2/1/1]: job c
                    + manually assigned [2/1/1]: job d
        
                would indicate that `job a` is *finished*, `job b`  and `job c` are *available* (have no unfinished prerequistites) and that `job d` is *waiting* (has one or more unfinished prerequisties). The status indicator in square brackets indicates the numbers of available, waiting and finished jobs in the task, respectively.
        
        - An entry for `@e` can be given with or without an `@s` entry and is interpreted as the estimated time required to complete the task.
        - When a job is finished, the "done" datetime is recorded in an `&f` entry in the job. When the last job in a task is finished or when a task without jobs is finished a similar entry in the task itself using `@f done`. If there are jobs, then the `&f` entries are removed from the jobs. 
        - Another step is taken for repeating tasks with as yet unfinished future repetitions. When the task or last job in the current repetition is completed, the `@s` entry is updated using the setting for `@o` to show the next due datetime and the `@f` entry is removed and appended to the list of completions in `@h`. A user configuration setting determines the number of most recent completion records retained for repeating tasks with 3 as the default.  
        - When the last instance of a repeating task is finished, `@f` will contain the datetime of the last completion and `@h` the list of prior completions.
        - A task, repeating or not, will have an  `@f` entry if and only if the task has been completed.
        
        Corresponds to VTODO in the vcalendar specification.
        
        ### [record](#etm)
        
        Type character: **%**
        
        A record of something that the user wants to remember. The userid and password for a website would be an example. A journal entry for vacation day is another example. 
        
        - The `@s` is optional and, if given, is interpreted as the datetime to which the record applies. 
        - Records without @s entries might be used to record personal information such as account numbers, recipies or other such information not associated with a particular datetime. They are displayed in the *Journal* view
        - Records with @s entries associate the record with the datetime given by @s. A vacation log entry, for example, might record the highlights of the day given by @s. They are displayed in the *Agenda* view as well as the *Journal* view.
        
        Corresponds to VJOURNAL in the vcalendar specification.
        
        ### [inbox](#etm)
        
        Type character: **!**
        
        An inbox item can be regarded as a task that is always due on the current date. E.g., you have created an event to remind you of a lunch meeting but need to confirm the time. Just record it using **!** instead of **\*** and the entry  will appear highlighted in the agenda view on the current date until you confirm the starting time. 
        
        Corresponds to VTODO in the vcalendar specification.
        
        ### [status](#etm)
        
        These type characters are generated automatically by *etm* to display the status of reminders.
        
        #### [beginning soon](#etm)
        
        Type character: **>**
        
        For unfinished tasks and other items with `@b` entries, when the starting date given by `@s` is within `@b` days of the current date, a warning that the item is beginning soon appears on the current date together with the item summary and the number of days remaining.
        
        #### [past due](#etm)
        
        Type character: **<**
        
        When a task is past due, a warning that the task is past due appears on the current date together with the item summary and the number of days past due. 
        
        #### [waiting](#etm)
        
        Type character: **+**
        
        When a task job has one or more unfinished prerequisites, it is displayed using **+** rather than **-**.
        
        #### [finished](#etm)
        
        Type character: **✓**
        
        When a task or job is finished, it is displayed on the finished date using **✓** rather than **-**. 
        
        ## [Options](#etm)
        
        Note: The term "list" in the following means a comma and space separated list of elements, e.g., 
        
            @+ 2p Thu, 9p Mon, 11a Wed
        Options with an asterick can be used more than once, e.g., 
        
            @n Joe Doaks <jdoaks@whatever.com @n John Smith <jsmith@wherever.org> 
        or
        
            @a 1h, 30m: t, v @a 1d: e
        
        ### [@ keys](#etm) 
        
        `@` followed by a character from the list below and a value appropriate to the key is used to apply attributes to an item. E.g.,
        
                    @s mon 9a
        would specify the the starting datetime for the item is 9am on the Monday following the current date.
        
        *  @+: include. list of datetimes to include
        *  @-: exclude. list of datetimes to exclude
        *  @a*: alert. list of + (before) or - (after) periods: list of commands

        *  @p: priority. integer from 0 (none), 1 (low), 2 (normal), 3 (high), 4 (urgent)
        *  @r*: repetition frequency, a character from (y)early, (m)onthly, (w)eekly,  
          (d)aily, (h)ourly or mi(n)utely, optionally followed by repetition &key entries
        *  @s: start/due. date or datetime
        *  @t*: tag. string
        *  @u*: usedtime. string using "timeperiod spent: ending datetime" format
        *  @x*: expansion. string
        *  @z: timezone. string
        
        
        ### [& keys](#etm)
        
        & followed by a character from one of the lists below. These keys are only used with @j (job) and @r (repetition) entries.
        
        For use with @j:
        
        *  &s: start/due: period relative to @s entry (default 0m)
        *  &a: alert: list of + (before) or - (after) periods relative to &s: list of cmd names from the users configuration file
        *  &b: beginby. integer number of days before &s
        *  &d: description. string

        *  &p: prerequisites. list of ids of immediate prereqs
        *  &u*: usedtime. string using "timeperiod spent: ending datetime" format
        
        For use with @r:
        
        *  &c: count. integer number of repetitions 
        *  &E: easter. number of days before (-), on (0) or after (+) Easter
        *  &h: hour. list of integers in 0 ... 23

        *  &w: weekday. list from SU, MO, ..., SA possibly prepended with a positive or negative integer
        *  &W: week number. list of integers in 1, ..., 53
        
        
        ### [Notes](#etm)
        
        @a alerts and @b beginbys:
        
        * With an email alert, the item summary is used as the subject and emails are sent to each attendee listed in an @n entry. The content of the body of the emails is a option that can be set in the user's configuration file. 
        * Alerts and beginbys are only triggered for unfinished tasks and, when the task is repeating, only for the first unfinished instance. Similarly, pastdue notices for repeating tasks are only triggered for the first unfinished instance.
        
        Repetition:
        
        * Using @s, @r and, optionally, @+. Datetimes from @+, if any, are added to the datetimes generated from the @r entry which fall on or after the @s datetime. Note that the datetime from @s will only be included if it matches one generated by the @r entry or by one included in @+.  
        
                * my event @s 2018-02-15 3p @r d &h 18 @+ 2018-03-02 4p
            would repeat daily at 6pm starting Feb 15 and at 4pm on Mar 2, *but not* at 3pm on Feb 15 which is specified in `@s`. 
        * Using @s and, optionally, @+ (but without @r). Datetimes from @+, if any, are added to @s. E.g., 
        
                * my event @s 2018-02-15 3p @+ 2018-03-02 4p
            would repeat at 4pm on Mar 2 *and* at 3pm on Feb 15 since `@r` is not specified.
        * Using &c and &u in @r. It is an error in *dateutil* to specify both &c (count) and &u (until) since providing both would at best be redundant. A distinction between using @c and @u is worth noting and can be illustrated with an example. Suppose an item starts at 10am on a Monday and repeats daily using either count, &c 5, or until, &u fri 10a.  Both will create repetitions for 10am on each of the weekdays from Monday through Friday. The distinction arises if you later decide to delete one of the instances, say the one falling on Wednesday, using @-. With *count*, you would then have instances falling on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday *and Saturday* to satisfy the requirement for a count of five instances. With *until*, you would have only the four instances on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday to satisfy the requirement that the last instance falls on or before 10am Friday.
        
        @m masked entry. These entries are encoded in the database in an obfuscated or masked format but decoded when displayed in etm itself. A key, *secret*, specified in the user configuration file is used for the encoding/decoding. E.g., a reminder that appears as
        
                % masked entry @s 2019-11-30 4pm @m obfuscated entry
        
        in *etm* could appear in the database as
        
                "1685": {
                "itemtype": "%",
                "summary": "masked entry",
                "s": "{T}:20191130T2100A",
                "m": "{M}:w5TDlsOTwpXDnMOWwoHDm8OXw4nCgcOZwo_DmcOmw6Y=",
                "created": "{T}:20191130T1642A",
                "modified": "{T}:20191130T1643A"
                }
        
        
        @x expansions. The `@x`, *expansion key*, entry is used to specify a key for options to be extracted from the etm configuration settings. E.g., suppose your configuration setting has the following entry for *expansions*:
        
                    expansions:
                        tennis: '@e 1h30m @a 30m, 15m: v @i personal:tennis'
                        ...
        Then when entering the following reminder
        
                * Conflict and Cooperation @s 1/25/2018 9:35am @x tennis 
        tab completion would offer `'@e 1h30m @a 30m, 15m: v @i personal:tennis'` as a replacement for `'@x tennis'`.
