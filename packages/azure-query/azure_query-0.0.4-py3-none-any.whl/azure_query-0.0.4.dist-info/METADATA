This is a CLI utility and pythong library for interacting with the Microsfot Graph REST API v1.0.

It provides a thin wrapper, that essentially makes REST calls to the Graph API and returns the JSON result.
It can be used as a library to create your own custom python tools that query the Graph API, and it also
comes with the executable `aq` which allows you to run queries from the command line.

It requires OAuth for access to the API, and will utilize a local web browser to obtain an access token.

Details on the Graph API v1.0 can be found on Microsoft's site
