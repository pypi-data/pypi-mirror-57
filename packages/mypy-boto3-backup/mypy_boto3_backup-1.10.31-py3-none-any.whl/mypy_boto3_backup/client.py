          - **BackupPlanName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The display name of a backup plan.

          - **Rules** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            An array of ``BackupRule`` objects, each of which specifies a scheduled task that is
            used to back up a selection of resources.

            - *(dict) --*

              Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of resources.

              - **RuleName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                >An optional display name for a backup rule.

              - **TargetBackupVaultName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are
                identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS
                Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and
                hyphens.

              - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --*

                A CRON expression specifying when AWS Backup initiates a backup job.

              - **StartWindowMinutes** *(integer) --*

                The amount of time in minutes before beginning a backup.

              - **CompletionWindowMinutes** *(integer) --*

                The amount of time AWS Backup attempts a backup before canceling the job and
                returning an error.

              - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --*

                The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and
                when it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically
                according to the lifecycle that you define.

                Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of
                90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the
                “transition to cold after days”. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot
                be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

                - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                  Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold
                  storage.

                - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                  Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. Must
                  be greater than ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`` .

        Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan.
        Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a ``ListOfTags`` and selected
        ``Resources`` .

        For example, consider the following patterns:

        * ``Resources: "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id"``

        * ``ConditionKey:"department"``    ``ConditionValue:"finance"``
        ``ConditionType:"StringEquals"``

        * ``ConditionKey:"importance"``    ``ConditionValue:"critical"``
        ``ConditionType:"StringEquals"``

        Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that
        are tagged as ``"department=finance"`` , ``"importance=critical"`` , in addition to an EBS
        volume with the specified volume Id.

        Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are
        selected. This shouldn't be confused with a logical AND, where all conditions must match.
        The matching patterns are logically 'put together using the OR operator. In other words, all
        patterns that match are selected for backup.

                An operation, such as ``StringEquals`` , that is applied to a key-value pair used to

              Specifies the time in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when a backup
              job must be started before it is canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start
              window to the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start
              window is 2 hours, the ``StartBy`` time would be 8:00 PM on the date specified. The
              value of ``StartBy`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value

                A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

            - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --*

              The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and
              when it expires. AWS Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to
              the lifecycle that you define.

              Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a
              minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater
              than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days”
              setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

              - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold
                storage.

              - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. Must
                be greater than ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`` .

            - **EncryptionKeyArn** *(string) --*

              The server-side encryption key used to protect your backups; for example,
              ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` .

            - **IsEncrypted** *(boolean) --*

              A Boolean value that is returned as ``TRUE`` if the specified recovery point is
              encrypted, or ``FALSE`` if the recovery point is not encrypted.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Specifies the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values are ``WARM`` or
              ``COLD`` .

            - **LastRestoreTime** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time that a recovery point was last restored, in Unix format and
              Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``LastRestoreTime`` is accurate to
              milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26,
              2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

                  - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --*

                    The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage
                    and when it expires. AWS Backup transitions and expires backups automatically
                    according to the lifecycle that you define.

                    Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a
                    minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days
                    greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to
                    cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned
                    to cold.

              Unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that are at most 1,024
              bytes long. Version IDs cannot be edited.

            - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --*

              A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
              without the risk of executing the operation twice.

            - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time that a backup plan is created, in Unix format and Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreationDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For
              example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

            - **DeletionDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time that a backup plan is deleted, in Unix format and Coordinated

                  Contains an array of triplets made up of a condition type (such as
                  ``StringEquals`` ), a key, and a value. Conditions are used to filter resources in
                  a selection that is assigned to a backup plan.

                  - **ConditionType** *(string) --*

                    An operation, such as ``StringEquals`` , that is applied to a key-value pair

              The date and time a backup selection is created, in Unix format and Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreationDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For
              example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

            - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --*

              A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
              without the risk of executing the operation twice.

                - **StartBy** *(datetime) --*

                  Specifies the time in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when a
                  backup job must be started before it is canceled. The value is calculated by
                  adding the start window to the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00
                  PM and the start window is 2 hours, the ``StartBy`` time would be 8:00 PM on the
                  date specified. The value of ``StartBy`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
                  the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              The next item following a partial list of returned items. For example, if a request is
              made to return ``maxResults`` number of items, ``NextToken`` allows you to return more
              items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

                    A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

                - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --*

                  The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage
                  and when it expires. AWS Backup transitions and expires backups automatically
                  according to the lifecycle that you define.

                  Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum
                  of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater
                  than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after
                  days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

                  - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                    Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to
                    cold storage.

                  - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --*

                    Specifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted.
                    Must be greater than ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`` .

                - **EncryptionKeyArn** *(string) --*

                  The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups; for example,
                  ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` .

                - **IsEncrypted** *(boolean) --*

                  A Boolean value that is returned as ``TRUE`` if the specified recovery point is
                  encrypted, or ``FALSE`` if the recovery point is not encrypted.

                - **LastRestoreTime** *(datetime) --*

                  The date and time a recovery point was last restored, in Unix format and
                  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``LastRestoreTime`` is accurate to
                  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26,
                  2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
