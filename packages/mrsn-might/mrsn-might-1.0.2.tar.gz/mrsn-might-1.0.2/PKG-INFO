        ## Introduction
        
        MIGHT was developed as a way to automate many of the standard bioinformatics tasks that the MRSN
        performs as part of its surveillance mission.
        
        Brief summary of the workflow:
        
        1. Run [bcl2fastq](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq-conversion-software-v2-20.html) to demultiplex Illumina paired-end read data from MiSeq/Nextseq data
        2. Run [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) to get species ID and identify possible sample contamination
        3. Preprocess short reads using [bbduk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) for short read data and/or [filtlong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) for long read data
        4. Run the [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) assembler (with or without long read data)
        5. Run [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) to gather assembly statistics
        6. Run [Andale](https://gitlab.com/mrsn-bio/andale), a hybrid read/assembly AMR gene identification tool
        
        ## Installation
        
        This script is designed to be installed and run using conda
        
        ### Conda Installation
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        MIGHT can be run either on a __single isolate__ using Might.py or on all of the samples of an __Illumina run__ using AllMight.py. 
        The primary difference from an input perspective is that Might.py assumes that you are processing
        a single sample for which you will provide 1) the sample name and 2) the location(s) or the
        relevant input files. Conversely, AllMight.py will takes a user provided SampleSheet.csv
        to determine what samples should be included in the run. It will ultimately run the specified
        analyses on each sample as parallel implementations of the analysis methods found in Might.py.
        
        
        For a __single isolate__:
          ```
