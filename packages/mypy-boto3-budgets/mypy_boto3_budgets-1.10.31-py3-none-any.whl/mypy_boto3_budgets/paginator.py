          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            Response of DescribeBudgets

            - **Budgets** *(list) --*

              A list of budgets.

              - *(dict) --*

                Represents the output of the ``CreateBudget`` operation. The content consists of the
                detailed metadata and data file information, and the current status of the
                ``budget`` object.

                This is the ARN pattern for a budget:

                 ``arn:aws:budgetservice::AccountId:budget/budgetName``

                - **BudgetName** *(string) --*

                  The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and
                  ``\\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

                - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

                  The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans
                  utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

                   ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or
                   Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization
                   or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or
                   Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

                  - **Amount** *(string) --*

                    The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual
                    spend, or budget threshold.

                  - **Unit** *(string) --*

                    The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                    budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

                - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

                  A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports
                   monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

                  For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This
                  must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is
                  the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                  For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries
                  in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter
                  and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC``
                  in epoch seconds.

                  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for
                  quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining
                  periods.

                  If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits``
                  values from the start date of the budget.

                  After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the
                  budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the
                  planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

                   ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the
                   current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only
                   applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                    A generic string.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The amount of cost or usage that is measured for a budget.

                      For example, a ``Spend`` for ``3 GB`` of S3 usage would have the following
                      parameters:

                      * An ``Amount`` of ``3``

                      * A ``unit`` of ``GB``

                      - **Amount** *(string) --*

                        The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual
                        spend, or budget threshold.

                      - **Unit** *(string) --*

                        The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend,
                        or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

                - **CostFilters** *(dict) --*

                  The cost filters, such as service or tag, that are applied to a budget.

                  AWS Budgets supports the following services as a filter for RI budgets:

                  * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute

                  * Amazon Redshift

                  * Amazon Relational Database Service

                  * Amazon ElastiCache

                        A generic string.

                - **CostTypes** *(dict) --*

                  The types of costs that are included in this ``COST`` budget.

                   ``USAGE`` , ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization``
                   , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets do not have ``CostTypes`` .

                  - **IncludeTax** *(boolean) --*

                    Specifies whether a budget includes taxes.

                    The default value is ``true`` .

                  - **IncludeUpfront** *(boolean) --*

                    Specifies whether a budget includes upfront RI costs.

                    The default value is ``true`` .

                - **TimeUnit** *(string) --*

                  The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend.
                  ``DAILY`` is available only for ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` ,
                  ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

                - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

                  The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an
                  end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come
                  before ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

                  If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the
                  start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For
                  example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and
                  didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If
                  you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you
                  didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The
                  defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                  You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                  After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                  subscribers.

                  - **Start** *(datetime) --*

                    The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a
                    start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY,
                    MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on
                    January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your
                    start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your
                    start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS
                    Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                    You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                  - **End** *(datetime) --*

                    The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end
                    date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing
                    and Cost Management console and the API.

                    After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                    subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                - **CalculatedSpend** *(dict) --*

            - **Notifications** *(list) --*

              A list of notifications that are associated with a budget.

              - *(dict) --*

                A notification that is associated with a budget. A budget can have up to five
                notifications.

                Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS
                subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

                For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when
                you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

                * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``

                * A ``thresholdType`` of ``PERCENTAGE``

                * A ``comparisonOperator`` of ``GREATER_THAN``

                * A notification ``threshold`` of ``80``

                - **NotificationType** *(string) --*

                  Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (``ACTUAL`` ) or for how
                  much you're forecasted to spend (``FORECASTED`` ).

                - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

                  The comparison that is used for this notification.

                - **Threshold** *(float) --*

                  The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a
                  percentage.

                - **ThresholdType** *(string) --*

                  The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, AWS
                  notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost
                  threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are
                  forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example,
                  if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of
                  80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

                - **NotificationState** *(string) --*

                  Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the
                  ``ALARM`` state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.
