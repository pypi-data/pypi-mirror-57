        :type AccountId: string
        :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]**

          The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget.

        :type Budget: dict
        :param Budget: **[REQUIRED]**

          The budget object that you want to create.

          - **BudgetName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and ``\\``
            characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

          - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

            The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization,
            or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

             ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings
             Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage
             budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans
             utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with
             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

            - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or
              budget threshold.

            - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget
              threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

            A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and
             quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

            For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must
            start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of
            the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in
            standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and
            include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch
            seconds.

            If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly,
            provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

            If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values
            from the start date of the budget.

            After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget
            continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned
            budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

             ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits``
             will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit
             present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with
             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only
             contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

            - *(string) --*

              A generic string.

              - *(dict) --*

                The amount of cost or usage that is measured for a budget.

                For example, a ``Spend`` for ``3 GB`` of S3 usage would have the following
                parameters:

                * An ``Amount`` of ``3``

                * A ``unit`` of ``GB``

                - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend,
                  or budget threshold.

                - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or

             ``USAGE`` , ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and
             ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets do not have ``CostTypes`` .

            - **IncludeTax** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether a budget includes taxes.

              The default value is ``true`` .

              The default value is ``false`` .

          - **TimeUnit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. ``DAILY`` is
            available only for ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization``
            , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

          - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

            The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end
            date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before
            ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

            If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of
            your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you
            created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date,
            AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set
            your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set
            your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing
            and Cost Management console and the API.

            You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
            subscribers.

            - **Start** *(datetime) --*

              The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start
              date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY,
              or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose
              ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00
              UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` .
              The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            - **End** *(datetime) --*

              The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to
              ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost
              Management console and the API.

              After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
              subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

          - **CalculatedSpend** *(dict) --*

            The actual and forecasted cost or usage that the budget tracks.

            - **ActualSpend** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The amount of cost, usage, or RI units that you have used.

              - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or
                budget threshold.

              - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

            - **ForecastedSpend** *(dict) --*

              The amount of cost, usage, or RI units that you are forecasted to use.

              - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          - **BudgetType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            Whether this budget tracks costs, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans
            utilization, or Savings Plans coverage.

          notifications, and each notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email
          subscribers. If you include notifications and subscribers in your ``CreateBudget`` call,
          AWS creates the notifications and subscribers for you.

          - *(dict) --*

            A notification with subscribers. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10

                you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%,
                AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

                type and either an Amazon SNS topic or an email address.

                For example, an email subscriber would have the following parameters:

                * A ``subscriptionType`` of ``EMAIL``

                * An ``address`` of ``example@example.com``

                - **SubscriptionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            Response of DescribeBudget

            - **Budget** *(dict) --*

              The description of the budget.

              - **BudgetName** *(string) --*

                The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and
                ``\\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

              - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

                The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans
                utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

                 ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or
                 Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or
                 coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or
                 Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with
                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

                - **Amount** *(string) --*

                  The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend,
                  or budget threshold.

                - **Unit** *(string) --*

                  The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                  budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

              - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

                A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly
                 and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

                For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must
                start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the
                start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries
                in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter
                and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in
                epoch seconds.

                If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for
                quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining
                periods.

                If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values
                from the start date of the budget.

                After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the
                budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the
                planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

                 ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with
                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current
                 month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to
                 budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without
                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no
                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

                - *(string) --*

                  A generic string.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    The amount of cost or usage that is measured for a budget.

                    For example, a ``Spend`` for ``3 GB`` of S3 usage would have the following
                    parameters:

                    * An ``Amount`` of ``3``

                    * A ``unit`` of ``GB``

                    - **Amount** *(string) --*

                      The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual
                      spend, or budget threshold.

                    - **Unit** *(string) --*

                      The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                      budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

              - **CostFilters** *(dict) --*

                The cost filters, such as service or tag, that are applied to a budget.

                AWS Budgets supports the following services as a filter for RI budgets:

                * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute

                * Amazon Redshift

                 ``USAGE`` , ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` ,
                 and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets do not have ``CostTypes`` .

                - **IncludeTax** *(boolean) --*

                  Specifies whether a budget includes taxes.

                  The default value is ``true`` .

                ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

              - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

                The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an

                before ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

                If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start
                of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if
                you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a
                start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose
                ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't
                specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults
                are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                subscribers.

                - **Start** *(datetime) --*

                  The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start
                  date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY,
                  QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24,
                  2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to
                  ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to
                  ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost
                  Management console and the API.

                  You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                - **End** *(datetime) --*

                  date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and
                  Cost Management console and the API.

                  After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                  subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

              - **CalculatedSpend** *(dict) --*

                The actual and forecasted cost or usage that the budget tracks.

                - **ActualSpend** *(dict) --*

                    The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual
                    spend, or budget threshold.

                  - **Unit** *(string) --*

                    The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                    budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

              - **BudgetType** *(string) --*

                Whether this budget tracks costs, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans
                utilization, or Savings Plans coverage.

                    - **Start** *(datetime) --*

                      The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a
                      start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY,
                      MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on
                      January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your
                      start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your
                      start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS
                      Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                      You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                    - **End** *(datetime) --*

                      The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end
                      date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing
                      and Cost Management console and the API.

                      After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications
                      and subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget``
                      operation.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              A generic string.

          - *(dict) --*

            Response of DescribeBudgets

            - **Budgets** *(list) --*

              A list of budgets.

              - *(dict) --*

                Represents the output of the ``CreateBudget`` operation. The content consists of the
                detailed metadata and data file information, and the current status of the
                ``budget`` object.

                This is the ARN pattern for a budget:

                 ``arn:aws:budgetservice::AccountId:budget/budgetName``

                - **BudgetName** *(string) --*

                  The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and
                  ``\\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

                - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

                  The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans
                  utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

                   ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or
                   Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization
                   or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or
                   Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

                  - **Amount** *(string) --*

                    The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual
                    spend, or budget threshold.

                  - **Unit** *(string) --*

                    The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or
                    budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

                - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

                  A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports
                   monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

                  For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This
                  must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is
                  the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                  For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries
                  in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter
                  and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC``
                  in epoch seconds.

                  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for
                  quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining
                  periods.

                  If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits``
                  values from the start date of the budget.

                  After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the
                  budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the
                  planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

                   ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the
                   current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only
                   applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no
                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

                  ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

                - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

                  The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an
                  end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come
                  before ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

                  If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the
                  start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For
                  example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and
                  didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If
                  you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you
                  didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The
                  defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                  You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                  After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                  subscribers.

                  - **Start** *(datetime) --*

                    The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a
                    start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY,
                    MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on
                    January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your
                    start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your
                    start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS
                    Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                    You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                  - **End** *(datetime) --*

                    The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end
                    date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing
                    and Cost Management console and the API.

                    After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
                    subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

              - *(dict) --*

                A notification that is associated with a budget. A budget can have up to five
                notifications.

                subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

                For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when
                you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

                * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``

                * A ``thresholdType`` of ``PERCENTAGE``

                * A ``comparisonOperator`` of ``GREATER_THAN``

        :param NewBudget: **[REQUIRED]**

          The budget that you want to update your budget to.

          - **BudgetName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and ``\\``
            characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

          - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

            The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization,
            or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

             ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings
             Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage
             budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans
             utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with
             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

            - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or
              budget threshold.

            - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget
              threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

            A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and
             quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

            For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must
            start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of
            the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in
            standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and
            include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch
            seconds.

            If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly,
            provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

            If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values
            from the start date of the budget.

            After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget
            continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned
            budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

             ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits``
             will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit
             present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with
             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only
             contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

            - *(string) --*

              A generic string.

              - *(dict) --*

                The amount of cost or usage that is measured for a budget.

                For example, a ``Spend`` for ``3 GB`` of S3 usage would have the following
                parameters:

                * An ``Amount`` of ``3``

          - **TimeUnit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. ``DAILY`` is
            available only for ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization``
            , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

          - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

            The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end
            date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before
            ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

            If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of
            your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you
            created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date,
            AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set
            your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set
            your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing
            and Cost Management console and the API.

            You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
            subscribers.

            - **Start** *(datetime) --*

              The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start
              date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY,
              or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose
              ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00
              UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` .
              The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            - **End** *(datetime) --*

              The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to
              ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost
              Management console and the API.

              After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and
              subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            percentage.

          - **ThresholdType** *(string) --*

            The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, AWS
            notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold.
            For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go
            over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget
            for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when
            you go over 160 dollars.

          - **NotificationState** *(string) --*

            Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM``
            state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.

        :type NewNotification: dict
        :param NewNotification: **[REQUIRED]**

          The updated notification to be associated with a budget.

          - **NotificationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (``ACTUAL`` ) or for how much
            you're forecasted to spend (``FORECASTED`` ).

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The comparison that is used for this notification.
