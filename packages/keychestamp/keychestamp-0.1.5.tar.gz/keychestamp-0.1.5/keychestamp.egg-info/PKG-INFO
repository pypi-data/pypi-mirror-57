Description: # keychestamp - KeyChest ACMEv2 Proxy
        
        A simple proxy that logs activity of ACMEv2 clients (Let's Encrypt being the
        main ACMEv2 certificate issuer). The purpose is to provide a single source of data
         to manage use, and detect failures and malfunctioning of ACMEv2 clients.
        
        ## Summary
        
        Two big issues of using Let's Encrypt are client failures and rate-limits of Let's Encrypt.
        Undetected failures of local clients can happen as a result of server updates, software bugs, or changes in the issuance
        ecosystem. The rate-limits can be easily hit by a configuration error in a single
        Let's Encrypt client, or with the growth of the Let's Encrypt use.
        
        **keychestamp** is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy that extracts operationally important
        data from ACMEv2 requests. The data can be:
         
          - sent via a RESTful API to a monitoring service KeyChest, or
          - log locally into text files as JSON messages.
          
        The two options are independent. The former gives access to real-time notifications and online reports, the latter
        allows you use the proxy without any external dependencies.
        
        
        
        The proxy creates its own "root certificate" that is used to create
        local HTTPS connections between itself and ACMEv2 clients.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        **keychestamp** contains all necessary processing code but it depends on its
        environment and a correct integration.
        
        ## Install
        
        ### Install the application
        
        `pip install keychestamp`
        
        or 
        
        `pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir keychestamp`
        
        It needs read-write access to `/var/log/keychestamp` folder to store local logs, and
        optionally read-access to `/etc/keychestamp` for its configuration.
        
        The folders above can be prefixed with a command line switch `env`.
        
        
        ### Install supervisor for automatic restarts
        
        tbd
        
        ```
        [program:keychestamp]
        directory=/tmp
        command=keychestamp
        user=root
        autostart=true
        autorestart=true
        stderr_logfile=/var/log/keychestamp/error.log
        stdout_logfile=/var/log/keychestamp/audit.log
        ```
        
        You can adjust parameters as required.
        
        Restart the supervisor:
        
        `systemctl restart supervisord`
        
        `supervisorctl` - is a client, which shows status of processes - it has commands like:
         - start <name>
         - stop <name>
         - restart <name>
         - reread  # reads configuration files and shows changes
         - reload  # loads the new configuration to use for future commands
