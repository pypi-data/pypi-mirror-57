        ``jaraco.net`` provides miscellaneous utility functions used across
        projects developed by the author.
        
        DNS Forwarding Service
        ----------------------
        
        ``jaraco.net`` includes a DNS forwarding service for Windows. This is
        because Microsoft appears to be unable to bind to 6 to 4 and Teredo
        addresses with their production DNS Server. After installing
        ``jaraco.net``, the service executable is available as
        `%PYTHON%\Scripts\dns-forward-service.exe`. In addition to the
        documented install/uninstall/start/stop commands, it's also possible
        to configure a bind address with the -b option. For example::
        
            dns-forward-service -b 2002:41de:a625::41de:a625 install
        
        The service will be installed and the bind address will be stored in
        `HKLM\Software\jaraco.net\DNS Forwarding Service\Listen Address`. Note
        that the service must be restarted to recognize an updated bind address.
