        :type DnsConfig: dict
        :param DnsConfig:

          A complex type that contains information about the Amazon Route 53 records that you want
          AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

          - **NamespaceId** *(string) --*

            The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

          - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --*

            The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that AWS Cloud Map
            creates when you register an instance and specify this service.

            .. note::

              If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records,
              specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

            You can specify the following values:

             **MULTIVALUE**

            If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53
            returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

            For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health
            check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS
            queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight
            instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for
            all of the healthy instances.

            If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances
            are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

            For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__
            in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

             **WEIGHTED**

            Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the
            instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the
            same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

            For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health
            check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS
            queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy
            instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of
            the instances were healthy.

            If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances
            are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

            For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__
            in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record that you
            want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

            - *(dict) --*

              A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want
              AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

              - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in
                response to DNS queries.

                Note the following:

                * **A, AAAA, and SRV records:** You can specify settings for a maximum of one A, one
                AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.

                * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can't define any
                other records. This is a limitation of DNS: you can't create a CNAME record and any
                other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record.

                * **Alias records:** If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record
                when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` .

                * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you
                register an instance.

                The following values are supported:

                 **A**

                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.

                 **AAAA**

                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as
                2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                 **CNAME**

                Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the
                following:

                * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an
                instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes .

                * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` .

                * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for
                ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput``
                error.

                 **SRV**

                Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the
                following values:

                 ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                Note the following about the values:

                * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be
                changed.

                * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the
                ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.

                * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values:

                  * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.

                  * The name of the service.

                  * The name of the namespace.

                For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service is
                ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of
                ``service-hostname`` is:

                 ``test.backend.example.com``

                If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for
                ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the ``RegisterInstance``
                request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have
                the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore
                these records.

              - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings
                for this record.

                .. note::

                  Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS
                  resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the
                  ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request, the
                  ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a
                  service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

           *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional Route
           53 health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map associates the
           health check with all the Route 53 DNS records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

          .. warning::

            If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
            ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

          For information about the charges for health checks, see `AWS Cloud Map Pricing
          <http://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/pricing/>`__ .

          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
            determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

            .. warning::

              You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

            You can create the following types of health checks:

            * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
            submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
            than 400.

            .. warning::

               If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
               or later.

            * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for
            ``Type`` , don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` .

            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
            in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

          - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

            The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can
            be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when
            the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53
            automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value for
            ``ResourcePath`` , the default value is ``/`` .

            If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , you must *not* specify a value for
            ``ResourcePath`` .

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53
            to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa.
            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
            in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

        :type HealthCheckCustomConfig: dict
        :param HealthCheckCustomConfig:

          A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.

          .. warning::

            If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
            ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

            The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving an
            ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health status of a
            service instance. For example, suppose you specify a value of ``2`` for
            ``FailureTheshold`` , and then your application sends an
            ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request. Cloud Map waits for approximately 60
            seconds (2 x 30) before changing the status of the service instance based on that
            request.

            Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with the
            same value before ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the
            change. Cloud Map still waits ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds after the first request
            to make the change.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **Service** *(dict) --*

              A complex type that contains information about the new service.

              - **Id** *(string) --*

                The ID that AWS Cloud Map assigned to the service when you created it.

              - **Arn** *(string) --*

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Cloud Map assigns to the service when you
                create it.

              - **Name** *(string) --*

                The name of the service.

              - **NamespaceId** *(string) --*

                The ID of the namespace that was used to create the service.

              - **Description** *(string) --*

                The description of the service.

              - **InstanceCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances
                that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not
                included in the count.

              - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --*

                A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you
                want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                - **NamespaceId** *(string) --*

                  The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

                - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --*

                  The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that AWS
                  Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this service.

                  .. note::

                    If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records,
                    specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

                  You can specify the following values:

                   **MULTIVALUE**

                  If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy,
                  Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                  health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds
                  to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than
                  eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP
                  addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                  If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                  instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

                  For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer
                  Routing
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                   **WEIGHTED**

                  Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from
                  among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all
                  records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any
                  instances.

                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                  health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds
                  to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among
                  the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS
                  queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

                  If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                  instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected
                  instance.

                  For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                - **DnsRecords** *(list) --*

                  An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record that
                  you want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                  - *(dict) --*

                    A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you
                    want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53
                      returns in response to DNS queries.

                      Note the following:

                      * **A, AAAA, and SRV records:** You can specify settings for a maximum of one
                      A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.

                      * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can't define
                      any other records. This is a limitation of DNS: you can't create a CNAME
                      record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record.

                      * **Alias records:** If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias
                      record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` .

                      * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when
                      you register an instance.

                      The following values are supported:

                       **A**

                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as
                      192.0.2.44.

                       **AAAA**

                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as
                      2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                       **CNAME**

                      Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com.
                      Note the following:

                      * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you
                      register an instance. For more information, see
                      RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes .

                      * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` .

                      * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for
                      ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an
                      ``InvalidInput`` error.

                       **SRV**

                      Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses
                      the following values:

                       ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                      Note the following about the values:

                      * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be
                      changed.

                      * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the
                      ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.

                      * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following
                      values:

                        * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an
                        instance.

                        * The name of the service.

                        * The name of the namespace.

                      For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the
                      service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` ,
                      the value of ``service-hostname`` is:

                       ``test.backend.example.com``

                      If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for
                      ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the
                      ``RegisterInstance`` request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or
                      ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname``
                      in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

                    - **TTL** *(integer) --*

                      The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the
                      settings for this record.

                      .. note::

                        Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS
                        resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the
                        ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance
                        request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service;
                        you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or
                        non-alias records.

              - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

                 *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional
                 health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map associates
                 the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

                For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
                <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

                - **Type** *(string) --*

                  The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
                  determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                  .. warning::

                    You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

                  You can create the following types of health checks:

                  * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
                  submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and
                  less than 400.

                  * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
                  53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater
                  and less than 400.

                  .. warning::

                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS
                     v1.0 or later.

                  * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP``
                  for ``Type`` , don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` .

                  For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

                  The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path
                  can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
                  3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file
                  ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for
                  the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` , the default value
                  is ``/`` .

                  If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , you must *not* specify a value for
                  ``ResourcePath`` .

                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                  The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for
                  Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or
                  vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint
                  Is Healthy
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --*

                A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.

                .. warning::

                  If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
                  ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                  The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving
                  an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health
                  status of a service instance. For example, suppose you specify a value of ``2``
                  for ``FailureTheshold`` , and then your application sends an
                  ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request. Cloud Map waits for approximately 60
                  seconds (2 x 30) before changing the status of the service instance based on that
                  request.

                  Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with
                  the same value before ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds has passed doesn't
                  accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds
                  after the first request to make the change.

              - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --*

                The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated
                Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreateDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For
                example, the value ``1516925490.087`` represents Friday, January 26, 2018
                12:11:30.087 AM.

              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --*

                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be
                retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can
                be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

              - **Id** *(string) --*

                An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:

                * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an SRV
                record, the value of ``InstanceId`` is automatically included as part of the value
                for the SRV record. For more information, see  DnsRecord$Type .

                * You can use this value to update an existing instance.

                * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among
                instances that you register by using the same service.

                * If you specify an existing ``InstanceId`` and ``ServiceId`` , AWS Cloud Map
                updates the existing DNS records. If there's also an existing health check, AWS
                Cloud Map deletes the old health check and creates a new one.

                .. note::

                   The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while
                   if you submit a ``ListHealthChecks`` request, for example.

              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --*

                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed
                ``RegisterInstance`` requests to be retried without the risk of executing the
                operation twice. You must use a unique ``CreatorRequestId`` string every time you
                submit a ``RegisterInstance`` request if you're registering additional instances for
                the same namespace and service. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for
                example, a date/time stamp.

              - **Attributes** *(dict) --*

                A string map that contains the following information for the service that you
                specify in ``ServiceId`` :

                * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the service.

                * For each attribute, the applicable value.

                Supported attribute keys include the following:

                 **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME**

                If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record that routes traffic to
                an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated
                with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName"
                in the topic `AliasTarget
                <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html>`__ .

                Note the following:

                * The configuration for the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` must include
                settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.

                * In the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` , the value of ``RoutingPolicy``
                must be ``WEIGHTED`` .

                * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes ``HealthCheckConfig``
                settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the health check, but it won't associate the
                health check with the alias record.

                * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to
                AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.

                * If you specify a value for ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` , don't specify values for any
                of the ``AWS_INSTANCE`` attributes.

                 **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME**

                If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain name that you want
                Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``example.com`` .

                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings
                for an CNAME record.

                 **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4**

                If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want
                Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` .

                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings
                for an A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must
                specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

                 **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6**

                If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want
                Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example,
                ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` .

                This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings
                for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must
                specify a value for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

                 **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT**

                If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return
                for the port.

                If the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that you
                want Route 53 to send requests to.

                This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created
                the service.

          AWS Cloud Map returns up to 100 instances.

        :type NextToken: string
        :param NextToken:

          For the first ``GetInstancesHealthStatus`` request, omit this value.

          If more than ``MaxResults`` instances match the specified criteria, you can submit another
          ``GetInstancesHealthStatus`` request to get the next group of results. Specify the value
          of ``NextToken`` from the previous response in the next request.

                  The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that AWS
                  Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this service.

                  .. note::

                    If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records,
                    specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

                  You can specify the following values:

                   **MULTIVALUE**

                  If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy,
                  Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                  health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds
                  to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than
                  eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP
                  addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                  If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                  instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

                  For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer
                  Routing
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                   **WEIGHTED**

                  Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from
                  among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all
                  records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any
                  instances.

                  For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                  health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds
                  to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among
                  the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS
                  queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

                  If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                  instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected
                  instance.

                  For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__

                    A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you
                    want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                    - **Type** *(string) --*

                      The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53
                      returns in response to DNS queries.

                      Note the following:

                      * **A, AAAA, and SRV records:** You can specify settings for a maximum of one
                      A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.

                      * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can't define
                      any other records. This is a limitation of DNS: you can't create a CNAME
                      record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record.

                      * **Alias records:** If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias
                      record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` .

                      * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when
                      you register an instance.

                      The following values are supported:

                       **A**

                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as
                      192.0.2.44.

                       **AAAA**

                      Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as
                      2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                       **CNAME**

                      Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com.
                      Note the following:

                      * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you
                      register an instance. For more information, see
                      RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes .

                      * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` .

                      * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for
                      ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an
                      ``InvalidInput`` error.

                       **SRV**

                      Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses
                      the following values:

                       ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                      Note the following about the values:

                      * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be
                      changed.

                      * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the
                      ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.

                      * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following
                      values:

                        * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an
                        instance.

                        * The name of the service.

                        * The name of the namespace.

                      For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the
                      service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` ,
                      the value of ``service-hostname`` is:

                       ``test.backend.example.com``

                      If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for
                      ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the
                      ``RegisterInstance`` request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or
                      ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname``
                      in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

                    - **TTL** *(integer) --*

                      The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the
                      settings for this record.

                      .. note::

                        Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS
                        resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the
                        ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance
                        request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service;
                        you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or
                        non-alias records.

              - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

                 *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional
                 health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map associates
                 the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

                For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
                <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

                - **Type** *(string) --*

                  The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
                  determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                  .. warning::

                    You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

                  You can create the following types of health checks:

                  * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
                  submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and
                  less than 400.

                  * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
                  53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater
                  and less than 400.

                  .. warning::

                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS
                     v1.0 or later.

                  * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP``
                  for ``Type`` , don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` .

                  For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

                  The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path
                  can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
                  3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file
                  ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for
                  the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` , the default value
                  is ``/`` .

                  If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , you must *not* specify a value for
                  ``ResourcePath`` .

                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                  The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for
                  Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or
                  vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint
                  Is Healthy
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                  in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

              - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --*

                A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.

                .. warning::

                  If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
                  ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

                - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                  The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving
                  an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health
                  status of a service instance. For example, suppose you specify a value of ``2``
                  for ``FailureTheshold`` , and then your application sends an
                  ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request. Cloud Map waits for approximately 60
                  seconds (2 x 30) before changing the status of the service instance based on that
                  request.

                  Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with
                  the same value before ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds has passed doesn't
                  accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds
                  after the first request to make the change.

              - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --*

                The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated
                Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreateDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For
                example, the value ``1516925490.087`` represents Friday, January 26, 2018
                12:11:30.087 AM.

              - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --*

                A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be
                retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can
                be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

                      records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

                    You can specify the following values:

                     **MULTIVALUE**

                    If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy,
                    Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

                    For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                    health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53
                    responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If
                    fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query
                    with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                    If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                    instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

                    For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer
                    Routing
                    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__
                    in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                     **WEIGHTED**

                    Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from
                    among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all
                    records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any
                    instances.

                    For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a
                    health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53
                    responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance
                    from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds
                    to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

                    If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all
                    instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected
                    instance.

                    For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing
                    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__
                    in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                  - **DnsRecords** *(list) --*

                    An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record
                    that you want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that
                      you want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                      - **Type** *(string) --*

                        The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53
                        returns in response to DNS queries.

                        Note the following:

                        * **A, AAAA, and SRV records:** You can specify settings for a maximum of
                        one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any
                        combination.

                        * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can't
                        define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS: you can't create a
                        CNAME record and any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME
                        record.

                        * **Alias records:** If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias
                        record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type``
                        .

                        * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when
                        you register an instance.

                        The following values are supported:

                         **A**

                        Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as
                        192.0.2.44.

                         **AAAA**

                        Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as
                        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                         **CNAME**

                        Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com.
                        Note the following:

                        * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you
                        register an instance. For more information, see
                        RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes .

                        * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` .

                        * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for
                        ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an
                        ``InvalidInput`` error.

                         **SRV**

                        Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record
                        uses the following values:

                         ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                        Note the following about the values:

                        * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't
                        be changed.

                        * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the
                        ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.

                        * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following
                        values:

                          * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an
                          instance.

                          * The name of the service.

                          * The name of the namespace.

                        For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the
                        service is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` ,
                        the value of ``service-hostname`` is:

                         ``test.backend.example.com``

                        If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for
                        ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the
                        ``RegisterInstance`` request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates ``A``
                        and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of
                        ``service-hostname`` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

                      - **TTL** *(integer) --*

                        The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the
                        settings for this record.

                        .. note::

                          Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the
                          AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the
                          ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance
                          request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the
                          service; you can use a service to register instances that create either
                          alias or non-alias records.

                - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

                   *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an
                   optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map
                   associates the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

                  .. warning::

                    If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
                    ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

                  Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For
                  information about pricing for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
                  <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

                  Note the following about configuring health checks.

                   **A and AAAA records**

                  If ``DnsConfig`` includes configurations for both A and AAAA records, AWS Cloud
                  Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health of the
                  resource. If the endpoint that is specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy,
                  Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA records to be unhealthy.

                   **CNAME records**

                  You can't specify settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` when the ``DNSConfig``
                  includes ``CNAME`` for the value of ``Type`` . If you do, the ``CreateService``
                  request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.

                   **Request interval**

                  A Route 53 health checker in each health-checking region sends a health check
                  request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a
                  health check request about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't
                  coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second
                  followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.

                   **Health checking regions**

                  Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking regions. For a
                  list of the current regions, see `Regions
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions>`__
                  .

                   **Alias records**

                  When you register an instance, if you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME``
                  attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias record. Note the following:

                  * Route 53 automatically sets ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for alias records.
                  When ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is true, the alias record inherits the health of the
                  referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see
                  `EvaluateTargetHealth
                  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth>`__
                  .

                  * If you include ``HealthCheckConfig`` and then use the service to register an
                  instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't create the health check.

                   **Charges for health checks**

                  Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For
                  information about pricing for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
                  <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

                  - **Type** *(string) --*

                    The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
                    determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                    .. warning::

                      You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

                    You can create the following types of health checks:

                    * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
                    53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater
                    and less than 400.

                    * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route
                    53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater
                    and less than 400.

                    .. warning::

                       If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support
                       TLS v1.0 or later.

                    * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP``
                    for ``Type`` , don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` .

                    For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
                    Healthy
                    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                    in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                  - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

                    The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The
                    path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of
                    2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file
                    ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` . Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name
                    for the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` , the default
                    value is ``/`` .

                    If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , you must *not* specify a value for
                    ``ResourcePath`` .

                  - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                    The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for
                    Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy
                    or vice versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an
                    Endpoint Is Healthy
                    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
                    in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

                - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --*

                  A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A
                  custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to
                  evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:

                  * You can't use a health check that is defined by ``HealthCheckConfig`` because
                  the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom
                  health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of
                  resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)

                  * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources
                  are.

                  .. warning::

                    If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
                    ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

                  To change the status of a custom health check, submit an
                  ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request. Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status
                  of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent
                  ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request.

                  Here's how custom health checks work:

                  * You create a service and specify a value for ``FailureThreshold`` .  The failure
                  threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals you want AWS Cloud Map to
                  wait between the time that your application sends an
                  UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus request and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops
                  routing internet traffic to the corresponding resource.

                  * You register an instance.

                  * You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that is
                  associated with the new instance.

                  .. note::

                     AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly.

                  * The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and
                  notifies your application.

                  * Your application submits an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request.

                  * AWS Cloud Map waits for (``FailureThreshold`` x 30) seconds.

                  * If another ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request doesn't arrive during
                  that time to change the status back to healthy, AWS Cloud Map stops routing
                  traffic to the resource.

                  Note the following about configuring custom health checks.

                  - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

                    The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after
                    receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the
                    health status of a service instance. For example, suppose you specify a value of
                    ``2`` for ``FailureTheshold`` , and then your application sends an
                    ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request. Cloud Map waits for approximately

                    Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with
                    the same value before ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds has passed doesn't
                    accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``FailureThreshold x 30`` seconds
                    after the first request to make the change.

                  The date and time that the service was created.

              If the response contains ``NextToken`` , submit another ``ListServices`` request to
              get the next group of results. Specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous
              response in the next request.

                AWS Cloud Map gets ``MaxResults`` services and then filters them based on the

          The ID of the service that you want to use for settings for the instance.

        :type InstanceId: string
        :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]**

          An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:

          * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an SRV record,
          the value of ``InstanceId`` is automatically included as part of the value for the SRV
          record. For more information, see  DnsRecord$Type .

          * You can use this value to update an existing instance.

          * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that
          you register by using the same service.

          * If you specify an existing ``InstanceId`` and ``ServiceId`` , AWS Cloud Map updates the
          existing DNS records, if any. If there's also an existing health check, AWS Cloud Map
          deletes the old health check and creates a new one.

          .. note::

             The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while if you
             submit a ``ListHealthChecks`` request, for example.

        :type CreatorRequestId: string
        :param CreatorRequestId:

          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed ``RegisterInstance``
          requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. You must use a
          unique ``CreatorRequestId`` string every time you submit a ``RegisterInstance`` request if
          you're registering additional instances for the same namespace and service.
          ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

          This field is autopopulated if not provided.

        :type Attributes: dict
        :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]**

          A string map that contains the following information for the service that you specify in
          ``ServiceId`` :

          * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the service.

          * For each attribute, the applicable value.

          Supported attribute keys include the following:

           **AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME**

          If you want AWS Cloud Map to create an Amazon Route 53 alias record that routes traffic to
          an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the
          load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic
          `AliasTarget
          <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html>`__ in the
          *Route 53 API Reference* .

          Note the following:

          * The configuration for the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` must include
          settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.

          * In the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` , the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` must
          be ``WEIGHTED`` .

          * If the service that is specified by ``ServiceId`` includes ``HealthCheckConfig``
          settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the Route 53 health check, but it won't associate the
          health check with the alias record.

          * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS
          resources other than ELB load balancers.

          * If you specify a value for ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` , don't specify values for any of the
          ``AWS_INSTANCE`` attributes.

           **AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS**

          If the service configuration includes ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` , you can optionally use
          ``AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`` to specify the initial status of the custom health check,
          ``HEALTHY`` or ``UNHEALTHY`` . If you don't specify a value for ``AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS``
          , the initial status is ``HEALTHY`` .

           **AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME**

          If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain name that you want Route
          53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``example.com`` .

          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an
          CNAME record.

           **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4**

          If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53
          to return in response to DNS queries, for example, ``192.0.2.44`` .

          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an
          A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for
          ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

           **AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6**

          If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want Route
          53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example,
          ``2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`` .

          This value is required if the service specified by ``ServiceId`` includes settings for an
          AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value
          for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both.

           **AWS_INSTANCE_PORT**

          If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the
          port.

          If the service includes ``HealthCheckConfig`` , the port on the endpoint that you want
          Route 53 to send requests to.

          This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created the
          service.

           **Custom attributes**

          You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair, the maximum length of the
          attribute name is 255 characters, and the maximum length of the attribute value is 1,024

            - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 record that you want
              AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

              - *(dict) --*

                A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you
                want AWS Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns
                  in response to DNS queries.

                  Note the following:

                  * **A, AAAA, and SRV records:** You can specify settings for a maximum of one A,
                  one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in any combination.

                  * **CNAME records:** If you specify ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` , you can't define any
                  other records. This is a limitation of DNS: you can't create a CNAME record and
                  any other type of record that has the same name as a CNAME record.

                  * **Alias records:** If you want AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record
                  when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type`` .

                  * **All records:** You specify settings other than ``TTL`` and ``Type`` when you
                  register an instance.

                  The following values are supported:

                   **A**

                  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as
                  192.0.2.44.

                   **AAAA**

                  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as
                  2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                   **CNAME**

                  Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note
                  the following:

                  * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register
                  an instance. For more information, see  RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes .

                  * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy`` .

                  * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for
                  ``HealthCheckConfig`` . If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput``
                  error.

                   **SRV**

                  Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the
                  following values:

                   ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                  Note the following about the values:

                  * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be
                  changed.

                  * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the
                  ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request.

                  * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values:

                    * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.

                    * The name of the service.

                    * The name of the namespace.

                  For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test`` , the name of the service
                  is ``backend`` , and the name of the namespace is ``example.com`` , the value of
                  ``service-hostname`` is:

                   ``test.backend.example.com``

                  If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for
                  ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`` , ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`` , or both in the
                  ``RegisterInstance`` request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or
                  ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in
                  the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

                - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings
                  for this record.

                  .. note::

                    Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the AWS
                    resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the
                    ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a  RegisterInstance request,
                    the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use
                    a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

          - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --*

             *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional
             health check. If you specify settings for a health check, AWS Cloud Map associates the
             health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig`` .

            .. warning::

              If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
              ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

            Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For
            information about pricing for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
            <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

            Note the following about configuring health checks.

             **A and AAAA records**

            If ``DnsConfig`` includes configurations for both A and AAAA records, AWS Cloud Map
            creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health of the resource.
            If the endpoint that is specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers
            both the A and AAAA records to be unhealthy.

             **CNAME records**

            You can't specify settings for ``HealthCheckConfig`` when the ``DNSConfig`` includes
            ``CNAME`` for the value of ``Type`` . If you do, the ``CreateService`` request will fail
            with an ``InvalidInput`` error.

             **Request interval**

            A Route 53 health checker in each health-checking region sends a health check request to
            an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request
            about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't coordinate with one another, so
            you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no
            health checks at all.

             **Health checking regions**

            Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking regions. For a list of
            the current regions, see `Regions
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions>`__
            .

             **Alias records**

            When you register an instance, if you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute, AWS
            Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias record. Note the following:

            * Route 53 automatically sets ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` to true for alias records. When
            ``EvaluateTargetHealth`` is true, the alias record inherits the health of the referenced
            AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see
            `EvaluateTargetHealth
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth>`__
            .

            * If you include ``HealthCheckConfig`` and then use the service to register an instance
            that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't create the health check.

             **Charges for health checks**

            Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an AWS endpoint. For
            information about pricing for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing
            <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__ .

            - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53
              determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

              .. warning::

                You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

              You can create the following types of health checks:

              * **HTTP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
              submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
              than 400.

              * **HTTPS** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53
              submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less
              than 400.

              .. warning::

                 If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type`` , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0
                 or later.

              * **TCP** : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for
              ``Type`` , don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath`` .

              For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
              in the *Route 53 Developer Guide* .

            - **ResourcePath** *(string) --*

              The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can
              be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx
              when the endpoint is healthy, such as the file ``/docs/route53-health-check.html`` .
              Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value
              for ``ResourcePath`` , the default value is ``/`` .

              If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type`` , you must *not* specify a value for
              ``ResourcePath`` .

            - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --*

              The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route
              53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice
              versa. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is
              Healthy
              <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__
