        ===============================
        
        Jasmine integration for selenium.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You need two things to run jasmine tests with selenium:
        
        * A test app which requires your resources and jasmine test files::
        
            class MyTestApp(gocept.jasmine.jasmine.TestApp):
        
                def need_resources(self):
                    # Require your resources here
                    my.package.resource.need()
                    my.package.tests.jasmine_tests.need()
        
                @property
                def body(self):
                    # HTML setup for your tests goes here
                    return '<div id="my_container"></div>'
        
        * A TestCase with the jasmine layer::
        
            class MyJasmineTestCase(gocept.jasmine.jasmine.TestCase):
        
                layer = gocept.jasmine.jasmine.get_layer(MyTestApp())
        
                def test_integration(self):
                    self.run_jasmine()
        
        The important things here are, that the `get_layer` function is given
        your jasmine app and that the returned Layer is used on your TestCase.
        
        In your Test, simple run `run_jasmine`, which will open the TestApp in your
        Browser. The TestApp renders your `body` and includes all needed resources and
        then runs the jasmine tests. `run_jasmine` will wait for these tests to finish
        and the report success or failure. Jasmine tracebacks and error details are
        visible through the selenium error handling.
        
        
        Debugging
        ---------
        
        You can set the `debug` flag on your test case to get a pdb debugger right
        after the start of the jasmine tests. This lets you debug your jasmine tests
        within your browser::
        
            class MyJasmineTestCase(gocept.jasmine.jasmine.TestCase):
        
                layer = gocept.jasmine.jasmine.get_layer(MyTestApp())
                debug = True
        
                def test_integration(self):
                    self.run_jasmine()
