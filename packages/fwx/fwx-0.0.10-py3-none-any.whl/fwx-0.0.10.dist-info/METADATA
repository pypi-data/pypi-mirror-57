# fwx

fwx isn't a framework, it's a library.

fwx is used for the same kinds of applications as frameworks like Django or
Flask, but it works differently. Frameworks make you write code that the
framework then calls: the tool is using your code, not the other way
around. fxw is primarily a collection of functions, which you call from your
code. This way you're using the tool: the correct order of things.

## Installation

    pip install fwx
