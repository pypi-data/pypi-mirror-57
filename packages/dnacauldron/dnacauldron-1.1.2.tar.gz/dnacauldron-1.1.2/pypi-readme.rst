DNA Cauldron
===================

DNA Cauldron is a Python library to simulate restriction-based assembly operations. Provided the sequences of genetic parts and receptor vectors, DNA Cauldron will compute the assembli(es) that could result from the mix.

DNA Cauldron was written for Synthetic Biology applications - typically, to predict and validate batches of parts-based assemblies. It is simple to use, plays well with BioPython, can import and export Genbank (it conserves all features), and provides advanced methods such as connector part auto-selection, backbone selection for linear parts, methods to select constructs subsets when dealing with large combinatorial assemblies.
