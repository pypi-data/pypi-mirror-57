Run codeskulptor.org programs on the desktop using Qt/PySide2

To run an existing codeskulptor script on your local machine, simply import simplequi as simplegui:

    import simplequi as simplegui

    # The rest of your script goes here unchanged

Nothing else should need changing!

## Features

- Runs codeskulptor.org Python3 scripts using a Qt application
- The API matches simplegui exactly, so you should be able to run your script exactly as on codeskulptor.org after importing simplequi

## Installation

Get simplequi from pip:

    pip install simplequi

Or checkout the source code from https://github.com/ArthurGW/simplequi, then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Examples

Included in simplequi/examples are various scripts to show simple usages.

After installing simplequi, these can be run for example like this:

    python -m simplequi.examples.codeskulptor_default

## Known Issues

- Only supports the simplegui part of the codeskulptor API.
    - Does not support simplemap, simpleplot or other support  functions.
    - Support for simplemap and simpleplot is planned in future.
- Execution happens by the simplequi Qt application running when the Python interpreter is ready to shutdown
    - This can cause problems with some debuggers, but is fine for normal use.
    - Please report any issues you find with this!
- For now, only supports PySide2/qt-for-python
    - Support for PyQt will hopefully be added in future.
