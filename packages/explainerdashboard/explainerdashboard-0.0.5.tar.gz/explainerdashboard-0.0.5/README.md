# explainerdashboard

This package makes it more convenient to quickly explain the workings of a
fitted machine learning model. 

By constructing an ExplainerBunch object, you can quickly generate plots to
visualise shap values, permutation feature importance, contributions to 
individual predictions, dependency plots, interactions plots, individual decision 
trees in random forests, etc.

You can then quickly start an ExplainerDashboard to start a webapp with an
interactive dashboard to interrogate your model, show the interpretability to 
management, or explain specific predictions.
