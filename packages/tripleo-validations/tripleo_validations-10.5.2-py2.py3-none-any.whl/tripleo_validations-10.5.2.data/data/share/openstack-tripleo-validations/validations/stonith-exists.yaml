        We don't configure stonith device with TripleO Installer. Because the hardware
        configuration may be differ in each environment and requires different fence agents.
        How to configure fencing please read https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/paged/director-installation-and-usage/86-fencing-the-controller-nodes
