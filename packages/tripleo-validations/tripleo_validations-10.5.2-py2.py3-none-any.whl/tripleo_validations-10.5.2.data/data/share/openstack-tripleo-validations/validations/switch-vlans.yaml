      name: Compare switch port VLANs to VLANs in nic config
      description: >
        LLDP data received during introspection contains the configured VLANs
        for each switch port attached to the nodes interfaces.  Compare the
        VLAN IDs set on the switch port to those configured in nic config
        files. Since the mapping of roles to nodes isn't known prior to
        deployment, this check can only check VLANs across all switch ports,
        not on a particular switch port.
