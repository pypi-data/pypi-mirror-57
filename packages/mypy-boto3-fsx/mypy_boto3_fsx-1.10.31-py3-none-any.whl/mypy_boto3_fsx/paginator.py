        :type BackupIds: list
        :param BackupIds:

          (Optional) IDs of the backups you want to retrieve (String). This overrides any filters.
          If any IDs are not found, BackupNotFound will be thrown.

          - *(string) --*

            The ID of the backup. Specifies the backup to use if you're creating a file system from
            an existing backup.

        :type Filters: list
        :param Filters:

          (Optional) Filters structure. Supported names are file-system-id and backup-type.

          - *(dict) --*

            A filter used to restrict the results of describe calls. You can use multiple filters to
            return results that meet all applied filter requirements.

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              The name for this filter.

            - **Values** *(list) --*

              The values of the filter. These are all the values for any of the applied filters.

              - *(string) --*

                The value for a filter.

        :type PaginationConfig: dict
        :param PaginationConfig:

          A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

          - **MaxItems** *(integer) --*

            The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than
            the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output
            that you can use to resume pagination.

          - **PageSize** *(integer) --*

            The size of each page.

          - **StartingToken** *(string) --*

            A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous
            response.

                    system.

                    * ``MISCONFIGURED`` indicates that the file system is in a failed but
                    recoverable state.

                      For ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` deployment types, this is the DNS name of the file system.

                      This endpoint is temporarily unavailable when the file system is undergoing

                      specified in ``SubnetIds`` property. Amazon FSx serves traffic from this
                      subnet except in the event of a failover to the secondary file server.

                      For ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` deployment types, this value is the same as that for
                      ``SubnetIDs`` .

                    - **PreferredFileServerIp** *(string) --*

                      For ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types, the IP address of the primary, or
                      preferred, file server.

                      Use this IP address when mounting the file system on Linux SMB clients or
                      Windows SMB clients that are not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory.
                      Applicable for both ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` and ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types. This
                      IP address is temporarily unavailable when the file system is undergoing
                      maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB clients that are joined to an Active
                      Directory, use the file system's DNSName instead. For more information and
                      instruction on mapping and mounting file shares, see
                      `https\\://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/accessing-file-shares.html

                    - **MaintenanceOperationsInProgress** *(list) --*

                      The list of maintenance operations in progress for this file system.

                      - *(string) --*

                        An enumeration specifying the currently ongoing maintenance operation.

                    - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --*

                      The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables

                      A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to
                      backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags on the
                      file system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups
                      where the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you
                      specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups.

                  - **LustreConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                      the response of the ``CreateFileSystem`` operation.

                      - **ImportPath** *(string) --*

                        The import path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional prefix) that you're

                        example ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If a prefix is specified
                        after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are
                        loaded into the file system.

                      - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

                        The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to

                        count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single
                        physical disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped
                        across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                        The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000
                        MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                - **DirectoryInformation** *(dict) --*

                  The configuration of the self-managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to which the
                  Windows File Server instance is joined.

                    Windows SMB clients that are not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory.
                    Applicable for both ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` and ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types. This IP
                    address is temporarily unavailable when the file system is undergoing
                    maintenance. For Linux and Windows SMB clients that are joined to an Active
                    Directory, use the file system's DNSName instead. For more information and
                    instruction on mapping and mounting file shares, see

                      ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If a prefix is specified after the
                      Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the
                      file system.

                    - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

                      The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to
                      store new and changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                    - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --*

                      For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe
                      count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                      disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                      limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                      The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.
