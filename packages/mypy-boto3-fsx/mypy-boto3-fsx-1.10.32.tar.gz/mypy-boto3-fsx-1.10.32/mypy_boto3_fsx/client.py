        Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. Creating
        regular backups for your file system is a best practice that complements the replication
        that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server performs for your file system. It also enables you
        to restore from user modification of data.

        If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this
        operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client
        request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns
        ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't
        exist, ``CreateBackup`` does the following:

        * Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of
        ``CREATING`` .

        * Returns the description of the backup.

        By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a ``CreateBackup`` operation without the
        risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in
        a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request
        token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result
        because all the parameters are the same.

        The ``CreateFileSystem`` operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still
        ``CREATING`` . You can check the file system creation status by calling the  DescribeBackups
        operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

        :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]**

          The ID of the file system to back up.

        :type ClientRequestToken: string
        :param ClientRequestToken:

          (Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent
          creation. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the AWS Command
          Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS SDK.

          This field is autopopulated if not provided.

        :type Tags: list
        :param Tags:

          The tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The key value of the ``Name`` tag
          appears in the console as the backup name.

          - *(dict) --*

            Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

            - **Key** *(string) --*

              A value that specifies the ``TagKey`` , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique
              for the resource to which they are attached.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              A value that specifies the ``TagValue`` , the value assigned to the corresponding tag
              key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you
              can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll :
              April`` .

                    - *(string) --*

                      An enumeration specifying the currently ongoing maintenance operation.

                  - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --*

                    The preferred time to perform weekly maintenance, in the UTC time zone.

                  - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --*

                    The preferred time to take daily automatic backups, in the UTC time zone.

                      The import path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional prefix) that you're
                      using as the data repository for your FSx for Lustre file system, for example
                      ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If a prefix is specified after the
                      Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the
                      file system.

                    - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

                      The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to
                      store new and changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                    - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --*

                      count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                      disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                      limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                      The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

              - **DirectoryInformation** *(dict) --*

        Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system.

        If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match,
        ``CreateFileSystem`` returns the description of the existing file system. If a file system
        specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns
        ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a file system with the specified client request token
        doesn't exist, ``CreateFileSystem`` does the following:

        * Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle
        state of ``CREATING`` .

        * Returns the description of the file system.

        This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
        idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same
        client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a
        ``CreateFileSystem`` operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This
        approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a
        file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your
        connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created
        a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

        .. note::

          The ``CreateFileSystem`` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still
          ``CREATING`` . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the
          DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other
          information.

              administering the file system remotely by using the FSx Remote PowerShell. The group
              that you specify must already exist in your domain. If you don't provide one, your AD
              domain's Domain Admins group is used.

            - **UserName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The user name for the service account on your self-managed AD domain that Amazon FSx
              will use to join to your AD domain. This account must have the permission to join
              computers to the domain in the organizational unit provided in
              ``OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName`` , or in the default location of your AD
              domain.

            - **Password** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The password for the service account on your self-managed AD domain that Amazon FSx
              will use to join to your AD domain.

            - **DnsIps** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              A list of up to two IP addresses of DNS servers or domain controllers in the
              self-managed AD directory. The IP addresses need to be either in the same VPC CIDR
              range as the one in which your Amazon FSx file system is being created, or in the
              private IP version 4 (Iv4) address ranges, as specified in `RFC 1918
              <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html>`__ :

              * 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)

              * 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)

              * 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

              - *(string) --*

          - **DeploymentType** *(string) --*

            Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are the following:

            * MULTI_AZ_1 - Deploys a high availability file system that is configured for Multi-AZ
            redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability. You can only
            deploy a Multi-AZ file system in AWS Regions that have a minimum of three Availability
            Zones.

            * SINGLE_AZ_1 - (Default) Choose to deploy a file system that is configured for single
            AZ redundancy.

            To learn more about high availability Multi-AZ file systems, see `High Availability for
            Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/high-availability-multiAZ.html>`__
            .

          - **PreferredSubnetId** *(string) --*

            Required when ``DeploymentType`` is set to ``MULTI_AZ_1`` . This specifies the subnet in
            which you want the preferred file server to be located. For in-AWS applications, we
            recommend that you launch your clients in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as your
            preferred file server to reduce cross-AZ data transfer costs and minimize latency.

          - **ThroughputCapacity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The throughput of an Amazon FSx file system, measured in megabytes per second, in 2 to
            the *n* th increments, between 2^3 (8) and 2^11 (2048).

          - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --*

            The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC
            time zone.

          - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --*

            The preferred time to take daily automatic backups, formatted HH:MM in the UTC time
            zone.

          - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --*

            The number of days to retain automatic backups. The default is to retain backups for 7
            days. Setting this value to 0 disables the creation of automatic backups. The maximum
            retention period for backups is 35 days.

          - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --*

            A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups.
            This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for the file system are
            copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify tags.
            If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are
            copied to backups.

        :type LustreConfiguration: dict
        :param LustreConfiguration:

          The Lustre configuration for the file system being created. This value is required if
          ``FileSystemType`` is set to ``LUSTRE`` .

          - **WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime** *(string) --*

            The preferred time to perform weekly maintenance, in the UTC time zone.

          - **ImportPath** *(string) --*

            (Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional prefix) that you're
            using as the data repository for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The root of
            your FSx for Lustre file system will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you
            select. An example is ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If you specify a prefix
            after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the
            file system.

          - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

            (Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx file system is
            exported. The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You
            can provide an optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from your
            Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an ``ExportPath`` value is not provided, Amazon
            FSx sets a default export path, ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`` .
            The timestamp is in UTC format, for example
            ``s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z`` .

            The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket specified by
            ``ImportPath`` . If you only specify a bucket name, such as ``s3://import-bucket`` , you
            get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that
            the input data in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the
            export path, such as ``s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]`` , Amazon FSx
            exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon S3 bucket.

          - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --*

            (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe
            count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The
            maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total
            number of disks that make up the file system.

            The chunk size default is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB).
            Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

                  For ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` deployment types, this is the DNS name of the file system.

                  This endpoint is temporarily unavailable when the file system is undergoing
                  maintenance.

                - **PreferredSubnetId** *(string) --*

                  For ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types, it specifies the ID of the subnet where the
                  preferred file server is located. Must be one of the two subnet IDs specified in
                  ``SubnetIds`` property. Amazon FSx serves traffic from this subnet except in the
                  event of a failover to the secondary file server.

                  For ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` deployment types, this value is the same as that for
                  ``SubnetIDs`` .

                - **PreferredFileServerIp** *(string) --*

                  For ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types, the IP address of the primary, or preferred,
                  file server.

                  Use this IP address when mounting the file system on Linux SMB clients or Windows
                  SMB clients that are not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory. Applicable for
                  both ``SINGLE_AZ_1`` and ``MULTI_AZ_1`` deployment types. This IP address is
                  temporarily unavailable when the file system is undergoing maintenance. For Linux
                  and Windows SMB clients that are joined to an Active Directory, use the file
                  system's DNSName instead. For more information and instruction on mapping and
                  mounting file shares, see

                  The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this to 0 disables
                  automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups for a maximum of 35 days.

                - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --*

                  A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system should be copied to
                  backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags on the file
                  system are copied to all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where
                  the user doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or
                  more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups.

                    The import path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and optional prefix) that you're using
                    as the data repository for your FSx for Lustre file system, for example
                    ``s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`` . If a prefix is specified after the
                    Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are loaded into the
                    file system.

                  - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

                    The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to store
                    new and changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                    count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                    disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                    limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                    The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                    (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

        Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
        backup.

        If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match,
        this operation returns the description of the file system. If a client request token
        specified by the file system exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns
        ``IncompatibleParameterError`` . If a file system with the specified client request token
        doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

        * Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial
        lifecycle state of ``CREATING`` .

        * Returns the description of the file system.

        Parameters like Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings
        default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can
        explicitly supply other settings.

        By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a ``CreateFileSystemFromBackup`` call
        without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an
        initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created.
        Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use
        the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client
        receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

        .. note::

          The ``CreateFileSystemFromBackup`` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is
          still ``CREATING`` . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the
          DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other
          information.

              - *(string) --*

          - **DeploymentType** *(string) --*

            Specifies the file system deployment type, valid values are the following:

            * MULTI_AZ_1 - Deploys a high availability file system that is configured for Multi-AZ
            redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability. You can only
            deploy a Multi-AZ file system in AWS Regions that have a minimum of three Availability
            Zones.

            * SINGLE_AZ_1 - (Default) Choose to deploy a file system that is configured for single
            AZ redundancy.

            To learn more about high availability Multi-AZ file systems, see `High Availability for
            Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/high-availability-multiAZ.html>`__
            .

          - **PreferredSubnetId** *(string) --*

            Required when ``DeploymentType`` is set to ``MULTI_AZ_1`` . This specifies the subnet in
            which you want the preferred file server to be located. For in-AWS applications, we
            recommend that you launch your clients in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as your
            preferred file server to reduce cross-AZ data transfer costs and minimize latency.

          - **ThroughputCapacity** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The throughput of an Amazon FSx file system, measured in megabytes per second, in 2 to
            the *n* th increments, between 2^3 (8) and 2^11 (2048).

            time zone.

          - **DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime** *(string) --*

            The preferred time to take daily automatic backups, formatted HH:MM in the UTC time
            zone.

          - **AutomaticBackupRetentionDays** *(integer) --*

            The number of days to retain automatic backups. The default is to retain backups for 7
            days. Setting this value to 0 disables the creation of automatic backups. The maximum
            retention period for backups is 35 days.

          - **CopyTagsToBackups** *(boolean) --*

            A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file system should be copied to backups.
            This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags for the file system are
            copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify tags.
            If this value is true, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are
            copied to backups.

                    count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                    disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                    limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                    The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                    (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

          The ID of the file system you want to delete.

        :type ClientRequestToken: string
        :param ClientRequestToken:

          (Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent
          deletion. This is automatically filled on your behalf when using the AWS CLI or SDK.

          This field is autopopulated if not provided.

        :type WindowsConfiguration: dict
        :param WindowsConfiguration:

          The configuration object for the Microsoft Windows file system used in the
          ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation.

          - **SkipFinalBackup** *(boolean) --*

            By default, Amazon FSx for Windows takes a final backup on your behalf when the
            ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation is invoked. Doing this helps protect you from data loss,
            and we highly recommend taking the final backup. If you want to skip this backup, use
            this flag to do so.

          - **FinalBackupTags** *(list) --*

            A set of tags for your final backup.

            - *(dict) --*

              Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

              - **Key** *(string) --*

                A value that specifies the ``TagKey`` , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique
                for the resource to which they are attached.

              - **Value** *(string) --*

                A value that specifies the ``TagValue`` , the value assigned to the corresponding
                tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For
                example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also
                of ``payroll : April`` .

        Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx for Windows File Server backups, if a
        ``BackupIds`` value is provided for that backup. Otherwise, it returns all backups owned by
        your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

        When retrieving all backups, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults`` parameter to
        limit the number of backups in a response. If more backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a
        ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the
        ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

        This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your backups.
        ``DescribeBackups`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then the action continues
        to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the last ``NextToken``
        value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

        When using this action, keep the following in mind:

        * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while
        still including a ``NextToken`` value.

        * The order of backups returned in the response of one ``DescribeBackups`` call and the
        order of backups returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

                        after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that prefix are
                        loaded into the file system.

                      - **ExportPath** *(string) --*

                        The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to

        Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx file systems, if a ``FileSystemIds`` value is
        provided for that file system. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned
        by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

        When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults``
        parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. If more file system
        descriptions remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. In this case,
        send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of
        ``NextToken`` from the last response.

        This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your file system
        descriptions. ``DescribeFileSystems`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then
        the action continues to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the
        last ``NextToken`` value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

        When using this action, keep the following in mind:

        * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while
        still including a ``NextToken`` value.

        * The order of file systems returned in the response of one ``DescribeFileSystems`` call and
        the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multicall iteration is
        unspecified.

                      count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                      disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                      limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                      The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                      (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              Present if there are more file systems than returned in the response (String). You can
              use the ``NextToken`` value in the later request to fetch the descriptions.

        Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows
        File Server.

        When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit
        the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a ``NextToken``
        value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request
        parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

        This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags.
        ``ListTagsForResource`` is called first without a ``NextToken`` value. Then the action
        continues to be called with the ``NextToken`` parameter set to the value of the last
        ``NextToken`` value until a response has no ``NextToken`` .

        When using this action, keep the following in mind:

        * The implementation might return fewer than ``MaxResults`` file system descriptions while
        still including a ``NextToken`` value.

        * The order of tags returned in the response of one ``ListTagsForResource`` call and the
        order of tags returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

                    The export path to the Amazon S3 bucket (and prefix) that you are using to store
                    new and changed Lustre file system files in S3.

                  - **ImportedFileChunkSize** *(integer) --*

                    For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the stripe
                    count and maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical
                    disk. The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is
                    limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system.

                    The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB
                    (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.
