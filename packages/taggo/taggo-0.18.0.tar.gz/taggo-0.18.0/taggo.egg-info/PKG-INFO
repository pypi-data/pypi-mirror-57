        Tag organizer that uses names of files and folders to create symlinks.
        Tags are defined by using #hashtags in the name. They can also be as many sub levels as you want, like #sub-hash-tag
        
        **note**
        This version is a completey different version than the old (https://github.com/xeor/taggo/tree/0.2).
        The old version works for python 2 (but not 3). It also had config-file instead of parameters. Check out the
        repo if you want it..

        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This project is in beta stage, please report bugs :)
        
        Any questions, thoughts, bugs are very welcome!
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * 3.6+
        
        
        Docker
        ------
        
        Start the container with environment variables like `CRON_TAGGO_0` with the format `* * * * *|run ....`
        
        * CRON_TAGGO_n where n is a number, start at 0, have as many as you want.
        * We take care automaticly that only 1 of each number is running at a time. Example, if one of your job is running every minute and it takes more than a minute to finish. It wont start the 2nd time.
        * The environment variable is split in 2 by a `|`. The first param is a cron, the 2nd is the parameters sent to the `taggo` command.
        
        FAQ
        ---
        
        * Why the name taggo?
        
          * It's a tagging tool. It does stuff with tags. What do you suggest? Tagging, taggs, tags, tag2fold... no.. Taggo!
        
        * Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?
        
          * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.
          * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?
          * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.
          * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage
            your files/photos.
        
        * There are just a bunch of empty folders created on windows
        
          * This is probably because you are not allowed to create symlinks (verify by running with debug). To allow yourself access to do that, go to `Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment` and add your account to `Create symbolic links`.

        History
        =======
        
        0.18.0 (2019-12-07)
        -------------------
        
        * Don't create symlinks if it's destination is in the symlink directory. This makes it possible to have the tag-directory inside the source-directory.
        
        0.17.1 (2019-12-06)
        -------------------

        0.17.0 (2019-12-05)
        -------------------
        
        * Added a parameter and functionality for alternative tag-lookup. You can now use `--tag-lookup frontmatter` using the run command
          if you want to also use frontmatter and data in `.md` files as tags. Use `tags` in frontmatter. It can be a list.
        
        0.16.0 (2019-06-03)
        -------------------
        
        * Lots of windows fixes
        
        0.15.0
        ------
        
        * pip-install error fixed (missing files)
        
        0.14.0

        * Small bugfixes
        
        0.13.0 (2018-03-04)
        -------------------
        
        * Dropping python 2.x support... Some things might end up being problematic to support. Like symlinks for directories in windows.
          So instead of making a bunch of hacks around functionality. It is now dropped.
        
        0.12.0 (2018-03-03)
        -------------------
        
        * Making symlink name template configurable
        * Symlink collision handling
        * Logs to stdout/stderr depending on message severety
        * Option to output log as json
        * Option to prompt/wait after each symlink. Usefull for debugging
        * Lots of things around symlink-name-templates, it's now completly configurable.
        * Possible to have extrainfo (used in symlink-name) from a tag parameter. Like #tag(info)
        * Using powerful filters to not symlink certain files, or only symlink some files.
        * Metadata-addons to use special file-info as in the symlink-name, like md5, stat, exif-data, ...
        * Output data as json, if you want a logparser to use it. Single-lines..
        * Configurable collision handling. If symlink already exist and points to a different file.
        * Making `pip install taggo[all]` to get all metadata-addon required libs
        * --auto-cleanup option in `run`
        * Log different messages to stdout or stderr
