The TOM Toolkit is a web framework for building TOMs: Target and Observation
Managers. TOMs are meant to facilitate collaborative astronomical observing
projects. A typical TOM allows it's users to curate target lists, request
observations of those targets at various observatories as well as manage and
organize their data. [Read more](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) about TOMs.

## Getting started with the TOM Toolkit
The [getting started guide](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/getting_started.html)
will guide you through the process of setting up a TOM for the first time.

## Reporting issues/feature requests
Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/issues) to
report any issues or support questions.

## Contributing to the project
If you'd like to contribute to the TOM Toolkit, first of all, thanks! Secondly, we
have a [contribution guide](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) that
you might find helpful. We are particularly interested in the contribution of
observation and alert modules.


## Plugins

### Antares
The [tom-antares](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_antares) plugin adds support
for querying the Antares broker for targets of interest.
