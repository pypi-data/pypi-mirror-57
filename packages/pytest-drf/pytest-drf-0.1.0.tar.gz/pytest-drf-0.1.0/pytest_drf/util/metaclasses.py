    By reordering base classes at subclass construction time, we allow the base
    classes to be declared with respect to readability â€” and without being forced
    to declare bases to appease the method resolution order (whereby the attributes
    from the first-listed base class win out against later-listed bases).

    This is used for Great Good with AsUser et al, because it reads better to
    declare AsUser *after* APIViewTest, but we don't want APIViewTest's default
    client fixture to overrule AsUser's.

    Example usage:

        class APIViewTest:
            # Set a default value for client
            client = static_fixture('unauthed_client')

        class AsUser:
            client = static_fixture('user_client')

        class PrioritizedAsUser(AsUser, metaclass=prioritize_bases(AsUser)):

            APIViewTest,
            AsUser,

            APIViewTest,
            PrioritizedAsUser,
        ):
            pass


        assert APIViewTest().client() == 'unauthed_client'
