        Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process
        associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information
        such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the
        AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are
        created in this AWS Region.

        You can activate the agent in a VPC (Virtual private Cloud) or provide the agent access to a
        VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public Internet.

        You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them
        need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source
        location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.

        Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures
        minimal interruption to your tasks.

          Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either by sending an HTTP GET
          request with redirects that enable you to get the agent IP address (port 80).
          Alternatively, you can get it from the AWS DataSync console.

          The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your agent
          in the query string parameter ``activationKey`` . It might also include other
          activation-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass
          to this API call determine the actual configuration of your agent.

          For more information, see Activating an Agent in the *AWS DataSync User Guide.*

        :type AgentName: string
        :param AgentName:

          The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text reference that is used to

        :type Tags: list
        :param Tags:

          The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to associate with the agent. The
          value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your
          agents.

          .. note::

            Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in
            UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          - *(dict) --*

            Represents a single entry in a list of AWS resource tags. ``TagListEntry`` returns an
            array that contains a list of tasks when the  ListTagsForResource operation is called.

            - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The key for an AWS resource tag.

          The ID of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoint that the agent has access to. This is
          the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a PrivateLink. If you don't have a PrivateLink
          VPC endpoint, see `Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration

          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets in which DataSync will create elastic
          network interfaces for each data transfer task. The agent that runs a task must be
          private. When you start a task that is associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one
          that has access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private. In this case,
          DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in your subnet. For a data transfer
          to work, the agent must be able to route to all these four network interfaces.

          target in the subnet specified.

          The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target) and security group S
          (which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage) is as follows:

          * Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow inbound access
          for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049) from security group S.
          You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

          * Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a rule that enables
          outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount targets. You can
          enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group. For
          information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for Amazon EC2

          The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from the NFS source
          location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path that's
          exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that
          it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network.

          To see all the paths exported by your NFS server. run "``showmount -e nfs-server-name`` "
          from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that
          appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export
          is accessible without Kerberos authentication.

          To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions
          to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with
          ``no_root_squash,`` or ensure that the permissions for all of the files that you want
          DataSync allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the
          files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute
          access.

          For information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7. The /etc/exports Configuration
          File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

        :type ServerHostname: string
        :param ServerHostname: **[REQUIRED]**

          The name of the NFS server. This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name
          of the NFS server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this host name to mount the
          NFS server in a network.

          .. note::

            This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4 (IPv4) address.

        :param OnPremConfig: **[REQUIRED]**

          Contains a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents that are used to connect to an
          NFS server.

        :param MountOptions:

          The NFS mount options that DataSync can use to mount your NFS share.

          - **Version** *(string) --*

            The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to mount your NFS share. If the
            server refuses to use the version specified, the sync will fail. If you don't specify a
            version, DataSync defaults to ``AUTOMATIC`` . That is, DataSync automatically selects a
            version based on negotiation with the NFS server.

            You can specify the following NFS versions:

            * **`NFSv3 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1813>`__ ** - stateless protocol version that
            allows for asynchronous writes on the server.

            * **`NFSv4.0 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3530>`__ ** - stateful, firewall-friendly
            protocol version that supports delegations and pseudo filesystems.

            * **`NFSv4.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661>`__ ** - stateful protocol version

             ``Subdirectory`` must be specified with forward slashes. For example
             ``/path/to/folder`` .

          To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions

          share, and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that
          you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group

        Creates a task. A task is a set of two locations (source and destination) and a set of
        Options that you use to control the behavior of a task. If you don't specify Options when
        you create a task, AWS DataSync populates them with service defaults.

        When you create a task, it first enters the CREATING state. During CREATING AWS DataSync
        attempts to mount the on-premises Network File System (NFS) location. The task transitions
        to the AVAILABLE state without waiting for the AWS location to become mounted. If required,
        AWS DataSync mounts the AWS location before each task execution.

        If an agent that is associated with a source (NFS) location goes offline, the task
        transitions to the UNAVAILABLE status. If the status of the task remains in the CREATING
        status for more than a few minutes, it means that your agent might be having trouble
        mounting the source NFS file system. Check the task's ErrorCode and ErrorDetail. Mount
        issues are often caused by either a misconfigured firewall or a mistyped NFS server host

          preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group ID (GID), file permissions, data
          integrity verification, and so on.

          For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the
          ``OverrideOptions`` before starting a the task execution. For more information, see the
          operation.

          - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the

            Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

            POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

            ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

            NONE: Skip verification.

          - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or
            preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be
            replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If
            you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to
            protect against overwriting those changes.

            Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For
            detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

          - **Atime** *(string) --*

            A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the
            file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to
            preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version
            before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across
            platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

            Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

            BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

              If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

          - **Mtime** *(string) --*

            A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was
            written to) before the PREPARING phase.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

            NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

              If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

          - **Uid** *(string) --*

            The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **Gid** *(string) --*

            The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

            A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source
            file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task
            deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
            classes. For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User
            Guide* .

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

            REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

          - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
            character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device
            name and metadata on the destination.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are
              nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

            Default value: NONE.

            NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

            PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
            supported for Amazon EFS.

          - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

            A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose
            such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore permissions.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

          - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

            A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
            DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

          - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If
            set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

            If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in
            series. For more information see  queue-task-execution .

        :type Excludes: list
        :param Excludes:

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should
          contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are
          delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example, ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

          - *(dict) --*

            Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
            from source to destination.

            - **FilterType** *(string) --*

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule
              type.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
              patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1
              |/folder2``

        :type Schedule: dict
        :param Schedule:

          Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination
          location. The schedule should be specified in UTC time. For more information, see
          task-scheduling .

          - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a
            source to a destination location.

        :type Tags: list
        :param Tags:

          The key-value pair that represents the tag that you want to add to the resource. The value
          can be an empty string.

          - *(dict) --*

            Represents a single entry in a list of AWS resource tags. ``TagListEntry`` returns an
            array that contains a list of tasks when the  ListTagsForResource operation is called.

            - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The key for an AWS resource tag.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              The value for an AWS resource tag.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination ENIs (Elastic Network Interface)
              that was created for your subnet.

              - *(string) --*

            - **Options** *(dict) --*

              The set of configuration options that control the behavior of a single execution of
              the task that occurs when you call ``StartTaskExecution`` . You can configure these
              options to preserve metadata such as user ID (UID) and group (GID), file permissions,
              data integrity verification, and so on.

              For each individual task execution, you can override these options by specifying the
              overriding ``OverrideOptions`` value to operation.

              - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at
                the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

                Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

                POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

                ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

                NONE: Skip verification.

              - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or
                preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be
                replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source
                file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use
                this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

                Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost.
                For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User
                Guide* .

              - **Atime** *(string) --*

                A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when
                the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync
                attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is,
                the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully
                standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

                Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

                BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

                .. note::

                  If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

                  If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

              - **Mtime** *(string) --*

                A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was
                written to) before the PREPARING phase.

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

                NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

                .. note::

                  If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

                  If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

              - **Uid** *(string) --*

                The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

                Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

                INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

              - **Gid** *(string) --*

                The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

                Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

                INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

              - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

                A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the
                source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If
                your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for
                certain storage classes. For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the
                *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

                REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

              - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
                and character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that
                device name and metadata on the destination.

                .. note::

                  AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are
                  nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

                Default value: NONE.

                NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

                PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
                supported for Amazon EFS.

              - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

                A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific
                purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore permissions.

                .. note::

                  AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

              - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

                A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
                DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=
                    1024*1024`` ).

              - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks.
                If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

                If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in
                series. For more information see  queue-task-execution .

            - **Excludes** *(list) --*

              A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list
              should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The
              patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1
              |/folder2"``

              - *(dict) --*

                Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring
                files from source to destination.

                - **FilterType** *(string) --*

                  The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN
                  rule type.

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
                  patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example:
                  ``/folder1|/folder2``

            - **Schedule** *(dict) --*

              The schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination
              location.

              - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --*

                A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer
                from a source to a destination location.

            - **ErrorCode** *(string) --*

              Errors that AWS DataSync encountered during execution of the task. You can use this
              error code to help troubleshoot issues.

            - **ErrorDetail** *(string) --*

              Detailed description of an error that was encountered during the task execution. You
              can use this information to help troubleshoot issues.

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            DescribeTaskExecutionResponse

            - **TaskExecutionArn** *(string) --*

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution that was described.
              ``TaskExecutionArn`` is hierarchical and includes ``TaskArn`` for the task that was
              executed.

              For example, a ``TaskExecution`` value with the ARN
              ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execution/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b``
              executed the task with the ARN
              ``arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2`` .

            - **Status** *(string) --*

              The status of the task execution.

              For detailed information about task execution statuses, see Understanding Task
              Statuses in the *AWS DataSync User Guide.*

            - **Options** *(dict) --*

              Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a
              StartTaskExecution operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID
              (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the
              destination, data integrity verification, and so on.

              A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option
              in  StartTaskExecution , the default value is used. You can override the defaults
              options on each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to
              StartTaskExecution .

              - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at
                the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

                Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

                POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

                ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

                NONE: Skip verification.

              - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or
                preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be
                replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source
                file. If you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use
                this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

                Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost.
                For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User
                Guide* .

              - **Atime** *(string) --*

                A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when
                the file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync
                attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is,
                the version before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully
                standard across platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

                Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

                BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

                .. note::

                  If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

                  If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

              - **Mtime** *(string) --*

                A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was
                written to) before the PREPARING phase.

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

                NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

                .. note::

                  If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

                  If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

              - **Uid** *(string) --*

                The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

                Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

                INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

              - **Gid** *(string) --*

                The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

                Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

                INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

              - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

                A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the
                source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If
                your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for
                certain storage classes. For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the
                *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

                REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

              - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
                and character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that
                device name and metadata on the destination.

                .. note::

                  AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are
                  nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

                Default value: NONE.

                NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

                PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
                supported for Amazon EFS.

              - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

                A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific
                purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

                Default value: PRESERVE.

                PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

                NONE: Ignore permissions.

                .. note::

                  AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

              - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

                A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
                DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=
                    1024*1024`` ).

              - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

                A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks.
                If set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

                If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in
                series. For more information see  queue-task-execution .

            - **Excludes** *(list) --*

              A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list
              should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The
              patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1
              |/folder2"``

              - *(dict) --*

                Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring
                files from source to destination.

                - **FilterType** *(string) --*

                  The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN
                  rule type.

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
                  patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example:
                  ``/folder1|/folder2``

            - **Includes** *(list) --*

              A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task. The
              list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include.
              The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example:
              ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

              - *(dict) --*

                Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring
                files from source to destination.

                - **FilterType** *(string) --*

                  The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN
                  rule type.

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
                  patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example:
                  ``/folder1|/folder2``

            - **StartTime** *(datetime) --*

              The time that the task execution was started.

            - **EstimatedFilesToTransfer** *(integer) --*

              The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the network. This value is
              calculated during the PREPARING phase, before the TRANSFERRING phase. This value is
              the expected number of files to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the
              content of the source and destination locations and finding the delta that needs to be
              transferred.

            - **EstimatedBytesToTransfer** *(integer) --*

              The estimated physical number of bytes that is to be transferred over the network.

            - **FilesTransferred** *(integer) --*

              The actual number of files that was transferred over the network. This value is
              calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during the TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated
              periodically when each file is read from the source and sent over the network.

              If failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than
              ``EstimatedFilesToTransfer`` . This value can also be greater than
              ``EstimatedFilesTransferred`` in some cases. This element is implementation-specific
              for some location types, so don't use it as an indicator for a correct file number or
              to monitor your task execution.

            - **BytesWritten** *(integer) --*

              The number of logical bytes written to the destination AWS storage resource.

            - **BytesTransferred** *(integer) --*

              The physical number of bytes transferred over the network.

            - **Result** *(dict) --*

              The result of the task execution.

              - **PrepareDuration** *(integer) --*

                The total time in milliseconds that AWS DataSync spent in the PREPARING phase.

              - **PrepareStatus** *(string) --*

                The status of the PREPARING phase.

              - **TotalDuration** *(integer) --*

                The total time in milliseconds that AWS DataSync took to transfer the file from the
                source to the destination location.

              - **TransferDuration** *(integer) --*

                The total time in milliseconds that AWS DataSync spent in the TRANSFERRING phase.

              - **TransferStatus** *(string) --*

                The status of the TRANSFERRING Phase.

              - **VerifyDuration** *(integer) --*

                The total time in milliseconds that AWS DataSync spent in the VERIFYING phase.

              - **VerifyStatus** *(string) --*

                The status of the VERIFYING Phase.

              - **ErrorCode** *(string) --*

                Errors that AWS DataSync encountered during execution of the task. You can use this
                error code to help troubleshoot issues.

              - **ErrorDetail** *(string) --*

                Detailed description of an error that was encountered during the task execution. You
                can use this information to help troubleshoot issues.

            ListLocationsResponse

            - **Locations** *(list) --*

              An array that contains a list of locations.

              - *(dict) --*

                Represents a single entry in a list of locations. ``LocationListEntry`` returns an
                array that contains a list of locations when the  ListLocations operation is called.

                - **LocationArn** *(string) --*

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the location. For Network File System (NFS) or
                  Amazon EFS, the location is the export path. For Amazon S3, the location is the
                  prefix path that you want to mount and use as the root of the location.

                - **LocationUri** *(string) --*

                  Represents a list of URLs of a location. ``LocationUri`` returns an array that
                  contains a list of locations when the  ListLocations operation is called.

                  Format: ``TYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR`` .

                  TYPE designates the type of location. Valid values: NFS | EFS | S3.

                  GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of the resource that backs the
                  location. An example for EFS is ``us-east-2.fs-abcd1234`` . An example for Amazon
                  S3 is the bucket name, such as ``myBucket`` . An example for NFS is a valid IPv4
                  address or a host name compliant with Domain Name Service (DNS).

                  SUBDIR is a valid file system path, delimited by forward slashes as is the *nix
                  convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export path to mount the location.
                  For Amazon S3, it's the prefix path that you mount to and treat as the root of the
                  location.

          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a  StartTaskExecution
          operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID),
          and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity
          verification, and so on.

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in
          StartTaskExecution , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on
          each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to  StartTaskExecution .

          - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the
            end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

            Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

            POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

            ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

            NONE: Skip verification.

          - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or
            preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be
            replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If
            you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to
            protect against overwriting those changes.

            Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For
            detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

          - **Atime** *(string) --*

            A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the
            file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to
            preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version
            before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across
            platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

            Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

            BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

              If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

          - **Mtime** *(string) --*

            A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was
            written to) before the PREPARING phase.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

            NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

              If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

          - **Uid** *(string) --*

            The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **Gid** *(string) --*

            The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

            A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source
            file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task
            deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
            classes. For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User
            Guide* .

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

            REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

          - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
            character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device
            name and metadata on the destination.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are
              nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

            Default value: NONE.

            NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

            PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
            supported for Amazon EFS.

          - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

            A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose
            such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore permissions.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

          - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

            A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
            DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

          - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If
            set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

            If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in
            series. For more information see  queue-task-execution .

        :type Includes: list
        :param Includes:

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task. The
          pattern should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include.
          The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe). For example: ``"/folder1
          |/folder2"``

          - *(dict) --*

            Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
            from source to destination.

            - **FilterType** *(string) --*

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule
              type.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
              patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1
              |/folder2``

        :type Options: dict
        :param Options:

          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of a  StartTaskExecution
          operation. Behavior includes preserving metadata such as user ID (UID), group ID (GID),
          and file permissions, and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity
          verification, and so on.

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't specify an option in
          StartTaskExecution , the default value is used. You can override the defaults options on
          each task execution by specifying an overriding ``Options`` value to  StartTaskExecution .

          - **VerifyMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the
            end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred.

            Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

            POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Perform verification (recommended).

            ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED: Perform verification on only files that were transferred.

            NONE: Skip verification.

          - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether files at the destination should be overwritten or
            preserved when copying files. If set to ``NEVER`` a destination file will not be
            replaced by a source file, even if the destination file differs from the source file. If
            you modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you can use this value to
            protect against overwriting those changes.

            Some storage classes have specific behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost. For
            detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User Guide* .

          - **Atime** *(string) --*

            A file metadata value that shows the last time a file was accessed (that is, when the
            file was read or written to). If you set ``Atime`` to BEST_EFFORT, DataSync attempts to
            preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version
            before the PREPARING phase). However, ``Atime`` 's behavior is not fully standard across
            platforms, so AWS DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

            Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

            BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file ``Atime`` value (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore ``Atime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Atime`` is set to BEST_EFFORT, ``Mtime`` must be set to PRESERVE.

              If ``Atime`` is set to NONE, ``Mtime`` must also be NONE.

          - **Mtime** *(string) --*

            A value that indicates the last time that a file was modified (that is, a file was
            written to) before the PREPARING phase.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve original ``Mtime`` (recommended)

            NONE: Ignore ``Mtime`` .

            .. note::

              If ``Mtime`` is set to PRESERVE, ``Atime`` must be set to BEST_EFFORT.

              If ``Mtime`` is set to NONE, ``Atime`` must also be set to NONE.

          - **Uid** *(string) --*

            The user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **Gid** *(string) --*

            The group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

            Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.

            INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --*

            A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source
            file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task
            deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
            classes. For detailed information, see  using-storage-classes in the *AWS DataSync User
            Guide* .

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

            REMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.

          - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
            character devices in the source file system, and recreate the files with that device
            name and metadata on the destination.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are
              nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

            Default value: NONE.

            NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

            PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently
            supported for Amazon EFS.

          - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --*

            A value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose
            such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

            Default value: PRESERVE.

            PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

            NONE: Ignore permissions.

            .. note::

              AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

          - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --*

            A value that limits the bandwidth used by AWS DataSync. For example, if you want AWS
            DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` (``=1024*1024`` ).

          - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --*

            A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If
            set to ``ENABLED`` , the tasks will be queued. The default is ``ENABLED`` .

            If you use the same agent to run multiple tasks you can enable the tasks to run in
            series. For more information see  queue-task-execution .

        :type Excludes: list
        :param Excludes:

          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should
          contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are
          delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``"/folder1|/folder2"``

          - *(dict) --*

            Specifies which files, folders and objects to include or exclude when transferring files
            from source to destination.

            - **FilterType** *(string) --*

              The type of filter rule to apply. AWS DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule
              type.

            - **Value** *(string) --*

              A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The
              patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1
              |/folder2``

        :type Schedule: dict
        :param Schedule:

          Specifies a schedule used to periodically transfer files from a source to a destination
          location. You can configure your task to execute hourly, daily, weekly or on specific days
          of the week. You control when in the day or hour you want the task to execute. The time
          you specify is UTC time. For more information, see  task-scheduling .

          - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            A cron expression that specifies when AWS DataSync initiates a scheduled transfer from a
            source to a destination location.

        :type Name: string
        :param Name:

          The name of the task to update.

        :type CloudWatchLogGroupArn: string
