*species* is a toolkit for analyzing spectral and photometric data of planetary and substellar objects. It provides a coherent framework for atmospheric characterization which builds on publicly-available data from various resources such as spectral and photometric libraries, atmospheric models, evolutionary models, photometry of individual targets, and filter transmission curves. All data are stored in a central database and there are tools available for creating color-magnitude diagrams, fitting atmospheric models and plotting the posterior distributions, creating synthetic photometry, plotting spectra and photometry, etc. The package has been released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/species/>`_ and is actively developed and maintained.
