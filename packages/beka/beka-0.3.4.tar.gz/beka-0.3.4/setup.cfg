summary = A bare-bones BGP speaker
long_description = 
	Beka is a fairly basic BGP speaker. It can send
	and receive unicast route updates in IPv4 and IPv6,
	but not too much else. It is designed to be simple to use
	and to extend, without too much overhead.
	
	It uses eventlet for concurrency, but is easy enough to port to
	gevent if that takes your fancy.
