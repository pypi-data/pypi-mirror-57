        Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request
        that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation
        token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the
        caller's AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:

        * Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and
        an initial lifecycle state ``creating`` .

        * Returns with the description of the created file system.

        Otherwise, this operation returns a ``FileSystemAlreadyExists`` error with the ID of the
        existing file system.

        .. note::

          For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.

        The idempotent operation allows you to retry a ``CreateFileSystem`` call without risk of
        creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that
        leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be
        that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the
        same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client
        can learn of its existence from the ``FileSystemAlreadyExists`` error.

        .. note::

          The ``CreateFileSystem`` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still
          ``creating`` . You can check the file system creation status by calling the
          DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state.

        This operation also takes an optional ``PerformanceMode`` parameter that you choose for your
        file system. We recommend ``generalPurpose`` performance mode for most file systems. File
        systems using the ``maxIO`` performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate
        throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most
        file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been
        created. For more information, see `Amazon EFS\\: Performance Modes
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html>`__ .

        After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to ``available``
        , at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC.
        For more information, see  CreateMountTarget . You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an
        EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information, see `Amazon
        EFS\\: How it Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html>`__ .

        This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem`` action.

        ::

          response = client.create_file_system(
              CreationToken='string',
              PerformanceMode='generalPurpose'|'maxIO',
              Encrypted=True|False,

                      'Key': 'string',
                      'Value': 'string'
                  },
              ]
          )
        :type CreationToken: string
        :param CreationToken: **[REQUIRED]**

          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure idempotent creation.

        :type PerformanceMode: string
        :param PerformanceMode:

          The performance mode of the file system. We recommend ``generalPurpose`` performance mode
          for most file systems. File systems using the ``maxIO`` performance mode can scale to
          higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of
          slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed
          after the file system has been created.

        :type Encrypted: boolean
        :param Encrypted:

          A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an
          encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying  CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId
          for an existing AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you
          don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, ``/aws/elasticfilesystem`` , is
          used to protect the encrypted file system.

        :type KmsKeyId: string
        :param KmsKeyId:

          The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter
          is only required if you want to use a nondefault CMK. If this parameter is not specified,
          the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:

          * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
          ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` .

          * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
          ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`` .

          * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
          ``alias/projectKey1`` .

          * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
          ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`` .

          If ``KmsKeyId`` is specified, the  CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter must be set
          to true.

        :type ThroughputMode: string
        :param ThroughputMode:

          The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two throughput modes to
          choose from for your file system: ``bursting`` and ``provisioned`` . If you set
          ``ThroughputMode`` to ``provisioned`` , you must also set a value for
          ``ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`` . You can decrease your file system's throughput in
          Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been
          more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more, see
          `Specifying Throughput with Provisioned Mode
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput>`__ in
          the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*

        :type ProvisionedThroughputInMibps: float
        :param ProvisionedThroughputInMibps:

          The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system that
          you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if ``ThroughputMode`` is set to
          ``provisioned`` . The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit
          increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information, see `Amazon EFS Limits That You
          Can Increase <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits>`__ in the
          *Amazon EFS User Guide.*

        :type Tags: list
        :param Tags:

          A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each
          tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a
          ``"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}"`` key-value pair.

          - *(dict) --*

            A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white space, and numbers that
            can be represented in UTF-8, and the following characters:``+ - = . _ : /``

            - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The tag key (String). The key can't start with ``aws:`` .

            - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The value of the tag key.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            A description of the file system.

            - **OwnerId** *(string) --*

              The AWS account that created the file system. If the file system was created by an IAM
              user, the parent account to which the user belongs is the owner.

            - **CreationToken** *(string) --*

              The opaque string specified in the request.

            - **FileSystemId** *(string) --*

              The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

              The time that the file system was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

            - **LifeCycleState** *(string) --*

              The lifecycle phase of the file system.

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              You can add tags to a file system, including a ``Name`` tag. For more information, see
              CreateFileSystem . If the file system has a ``Name`` tag, Amazon EFS returns the value
              in this field.

            - **NumberOfMountTargets** *(integer) --*

              The current number of mount targets that the file system has. For more information,
              see  CreateMountTarget .

            - **SizeInBytes** *(dict) --*

              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its
              ``Value`` field, and the time at which that size was determined in its ``Timestamp``
              field. The ``Timestamp`` value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The ``SizeInBytes`` value doesn't represent the size of a
              consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are
              no writes to the file system. That is, ``SizeInBytes`` represents actual size only if
              the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise,
              the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time.

              - **Value** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system.

              - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --*

                The time at which the size of data, returned in the ``Value`` field, was determined.
                The value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

              - **ValueInIA** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Infrequent Access
                storage class.

              - **ValueInStandard** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Standard storage
                class.

            - **PerformanceMode** *(string) --*

              The performance mode of the file system.

            - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --*

              A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is encrypted.

            - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --*

              The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was
              used to protect the encrypted file system.

            - **ThroughputMode** *(string) --*

              The throughput mode for a file system. There are two throughput modes to choose from
              for your file system: ``bursting`` and ``provisioned`` . If you set ``ThroughputMode``
              to ``provisioned`` , you must also set a value for ``ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`` .
              You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or
              change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the
              last decrease or throughput mode change.

            - **ProvisionedThroughputInMibps** *(float) --*

              The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system. Valid
              values are 1-1024. Required if ``ThroughputMode`` is set to ``provisioned`` . The
              limit on throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get these limits increased by contacting
              AWS Support. For more information, see `Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits>`__ in the *Amazon
              EFS User Guide.*

            - **Tags** *(list) --*

              The tags associated with the file system, presented as an array of ``Tag`` objects.

              - *(dict) --*

                A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white space, and numbers
                that can be represented in UTF-8, and the following characters:``+ - =
                     . _ : /``

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The tag key (String). The key can't start with ``aws:`` .

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  The value of the tag key.

        Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2
        instances by using the mount target.

        You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in
        a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system.
        If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of
        the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order
        to access their file system. For more information, see `Amazon EFS\\: How it Works
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html>`__ .

        In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the mount
        target and the file system's lifecycle state must be ``available`` . For more information,
        see  DescribeFileSystems .

        In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the following:

        * VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

        * Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

        * IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target (if you
        don't specify an IP address in the request)

        After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a
        ``MountTargetId`` and an ``IpAddress`` . You use this IP address when mounting the file
        system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the
        file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target
        can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see `How it
        Works\\: Implementation Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation>`__
        .

        Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be
        only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or
        more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount
        target must meet the following requirements:

        * Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets

        * Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount
        targets

        If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:

        * Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.

        * Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:

          * If the request provides an ``IpAddress`` , Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the
          network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same
          way that the Amazon EC2 ``CreateNetworkInterface`` call does when a request does not
          specify a primary private IP address).

          * If the request provides ``SecurityGroups`` , this network interface is associated with
          those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the
          subnet's VPC.

          * Assigns the description ``Mount target *fsmt-id* for file system *fs-id* `` where ``
          *fsmt-id* `` is the mount target ID, and `` *fs-id* `` is the ``FileSystemId`` .

          * Sets the ``requesterManaged`` property of the network interface to ``true`` , and the
          ``requesterId`` value to ``EFS`` .

        Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface.
        After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the ``NetworkInterfaceId`` field in
        the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and the ``IpAddress`` field to
        its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire ``CreateMountTarget`` operation
        fails.

        .. note::

          The ``CreateMountTarget`` call returns only after creating the network interface, but
          while the mount target state is still ``creating`` , you can check the mount target
          creation status by calling the  DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things
          returns the mount target state.

        We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are
        cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target
        created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see `Amazon EFS
        <http://aws.amazon.com/efs/>`__ . In addition, by always using a mount target local to the
        instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability
        Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system
        through that mount target.

        This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file system:

                  since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The ``SizeInBytes`` value doesn't represent the size
                  of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when
                  there are no writes to the file system. That is, ``SizeInBytes`` represents actual
                  size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of
                  hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any
                  point in time.

                  - **Value** *(integer) --*

                    The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system.

                  - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --*

                    The time at which the size of data, returned in the ``Value`` field, was
                    determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since

                    storage class.

                  - **ValueInStandard** *(integer) --*

                    The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Standard storage
                    class.

                - **PerformanceMode** *(string) --*

                  The performance mode of the file system.

                - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --*

                  A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is encrypted.

                - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --*

                  The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that
                  was used to protect the encrypted file system.

                - **ThroughputMode** *(string) --*

                  The throughput mode for a file system. There are two throughput modes to choose
                  from for your file system: ``bursting`` and ``provisioned`` . If you set
                  ``ThroughputMode`` to ``provisioned`` , you must also set a value for

          - *(dict) --*

            A description of the file system.

            - **OwnerId** *(string) --*

              The AWS account that created the file system. If the file system was created by an IAM
              user, the parent account to which the user belongs is the owner.

            - **CreationToken** *(string) --*

              The opaque string specified in the request.

            - **FileSystemId** *(string) --*

              The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

              The time that the file system was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

            - **LifeCycleState** *(string) --*

              The lifecycle phase of the file system.

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              You can add tags to a file system, including a ``Name`` tag. For more information, see
              CreateFileSystem . If the file system has a ``Name`` tag, Amazon EFS returns the value
              in this field.

            - **NumberOfMountTargets** *(integer) --*

              The current number of mount targets that the file system has. For more information,
              see  CreateMountTarget .

            - **SizeInBytes** *(dict) --*

              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its
              ``Value`` field, and the time at which that size was determined in its ``Timestamp``
              field. The ``Timestamp`` value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The ``SizeInBytes`` value doesn't represent the size of a
              consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are
              no writes to the file system. That is, ``SizeInBytes`` represents actual size only if
              the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise,
              the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time.

              - **Value** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system.

              - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --*

                The time at which the size of data, returned in the ``Value`` field, was determined.
                The value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

              - **ValueInIA** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Infrequent Access
                storage class.

              - **ValueInStandard** *(integer) --*

                The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Standard storage
                class.

            - **PerformanceMode** *(string) --*

              The performance mode of the file system.

            - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --*

              A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is encrypted.

            - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --*

              The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was
              used to protect the encrypted file system.

            - **ThroughputMode** *(string) --*

              The throughput mode for a file system. There are two throughput modes to choose from
              for your file system: ``bursting`` and ``provisioned`` . If you set ``ThroughputMode``
              to ``provisioned`` , you must also set a value for ``ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`` .
              You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or
              change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the
              last decrease or throughput mode change.

            - **ProvisionedThroughputInMibps** *(float) --*

              The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system. Valid
              values are 1-1024. Required if ``ThroughputMode`` is set to ``provisioned`` . The
              limit on throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get these limits increased by contacting
              AWS Support. For more information, see `Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits>`__ in the *Amazon
              EFS User Guide.*

            - **Tags** *(list) --*

              The tags associated with the file system, presented as an array of ``Tag`` objects.

              - *(dict) --*

                A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white space, and numbers
                that can be represented in UTF-8, and the following characters:``+ - =
                     . _ : /``

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The tag key (String). The key can't start with ``aws:`` .

                - **Value** *(string) --*

                  The value of the tag key.
