## About

The HotMaps Dispatch Model is a web user interface to develop energy system models.
It is based on [Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for modeling and [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/0.12.0/index.html) for visualization and interaction. 
The primary focus is flexible model creation with/and without the web user interface, and a high temporal resolution (hourly based) for the optimization. It has also the ability to execute and create many scenarios.  

A model can be fully defined by the web user interaface, with financal and technical details on technologies, demand,electricity,temperature and radiation profiles. You can also define and upload your own data. The Hotmaps Disptach Model takes these inputs and constructs an optimization problem, solves it, and reports back the results. The results are saved as HTML (for visialisation), JSON and EXCEL Files and can be further analyzed.


## How to install
1. install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. Download this [repository](https://github.com/tuw-eeg/hotmapsDispatch/archive/dev.zip) and save and unzip the content into your desired loacation

2. open the conda prompt in that location and type following comands 

    a. `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
    
    b. `conda activate hotmapsDispatch`
    
    c. `cd app/modules/common/FEAT/F16`

    d. ``python F16_server.py``

After that your default browser should open and the web user interface will show up

## Quick start 

> **Not implemented todo**

The Hotmaps Dispatch Model can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. 

Installing it is quickest with the `conda` package manager by running a single command: `conda create -c conda-forge -n  python=3.6 hotmapsDispatch`  


See the documentation for more [information on installing](https://hotmapsdispatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

and also some example are [included]()

The [Getting Started Guide](https://hotmapsdispatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a good place to start and to get a feeling how the model works.
