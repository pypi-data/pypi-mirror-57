            This method transforms the values to fit between -1 and 1, in order to be used in soundfiles.

            If the source file isn't a soundfile the target file will not be well formated,
            hence you should run this method to make the file well formated.

                *dividers: The number which each channel will be divided by in order to standardize that channel.

            NOTE:
                In order to maintain consistency throughout the dataset it is advised that the
                divider chosen for each channel to be a bit higher than the max value.
                It is also advised to keep record of the divider for each channel for future unstardartization.
                    
                Example:
                    Max amplitude is 75
                    divider chosen: 90.

            Returns:
