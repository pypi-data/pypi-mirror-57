# lignin-KMC
The official source for kinetic Monte Carlo polymerization packages developed to model lignin biosynthesis from first 
principle energetic calculations. Using this code, you can output either predicted properties (e.g. oligomer length 
and bond composition) from an ensemble of lignin structures, or the molfile for a single simulation. 
Currently the package simulates lignin polymerization of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) monolignols (in a specified 
ratio), or from caffeoyl (C) monolignols (only).

Further details are available in the manuscript ["Lignin-KMC: A Toolkit for Simulating Lignin 
Biosynthesis"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03534). Please cite this paper if you use this 
package.

Code Style: Python standard

# Motivation
Within the lignin community, there is a discrepancy in the understanding of how lignin polymerizes within the plant 
cell wall. This code was developed to help address some of these questions. In essence, the goal of this project was 
to use the first principles calculations of monomer/oligomer coupling kinetics to obtain quantitative lignin 
structural predictions

# Use

The following sections contain information on how to use lignin-KMC.

## Framework
This project runs on Python â‰¥3.6 with the following packages installed:
- rdKit (>= 2018.03.4.0; must be installed via conda; see below)
- common-wrangler (common_wrangler >= 0.2.4)
- SciPy
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib
- JobLib

## Installation

- For users with no Python experience, a helpful guide to installing Python via miniconda or anaconda can be found 
[here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html). 

- Once Python has been installed, you will need install [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html) using conda. 
  -  To install it in a new environment, run: `conda create -c rdkit -n lignin-kmc rdkit`, followed by 
     `conda activate lignin-kmc` 
  -  If you already have a conda environment created and want to add rdkit to that environment, instead run: 
     `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit`

-  In either case, Conda will install any missing required dependencies when it does so, and thus this may take a few 
 minutes.
 
- If you do not already have a `$HOME/.local/bin` directory, create one now, before installing lignin-kmc.
 
-  You can then install [lignin-kmc](https://pypi.org/project/common-wrangler/) using  pip (`pip install lignin-kmc`). 
Additional dependencies will again be installed as required.

### Command-Line Use

Lignin-KMC is populated with default variables that make it as easy to run as entering (on a terminal):

`> create_lignin`

This will use all default values (see below) and output which will look something like:
    
    Running Lignin-KMC version 0.2.2. Please cite: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03534
    
    Lignin KMC created 10 monomers, which formed:
           1 oligomer(s) of chain length 10, with branching coefficient 0.2
    composed of the following bond types and number:
        BO4:    6     BB:    1     B5:    1     B1:    0    5O4:    0    AO4:    0     55:    1
    
    Breaking C-O bonds to simulate RCF results in:
           4 monomer(s) (chain length 1)
           3 dimer(s) (chain length 2)
    with the following remaining bond types and number:
        BO4:    0     BB:    1     B5:    1     B1:    0    5O4:    0    AO4:    0     55:    1
    
    SMILES representation: 
     COc1cc(C(O)C(CO)Oc2c(OC)cc(C3OCC4C(c5cc(OC)c(OC(CO)C(O)c6cc(OC)c(OC(CO)C(O)c7cc(OC)c([O])c(OC)c7)c(-c7cc(C(O)C(CO)Oc8c(OC)cc(C(O)C(CO)Oc9c(OC)cc(C%10Oc%11c(OC)cc(/C=C/CO)cc%11C%10CO)cc9OC)cc8OC)cc(OC)c7OC(CO)C(O)c7cc(OC)c([O])c(OC)c7)c6)c(OC)c5)OCC34)cc2OC)ccc1[O] 


Your output will differ as a pseudo-random number generator is used to model the stochastic nature of chemical reactions.

The default options (number of initial and final monomers, S:G ratio, etc.) can be changed either by the command line 
options shown below, or by using a configuration file. These options can be viewed by entering the help command:

       functionality is desired, please start a new issue on the github.
     
       By default, the Gibbs free energy barriers from this reference will be used, as specified in Tables S1 and S2.
       Alternately, the user may specify values, which should be specified as a dict of dict of dicts in a 
       specified configuration file (specified with '-c') using the 'e_barrier_in_kcal_mol' or 'e_barrier_in_j_particle'
       parameters with corresponding units (kcal/mol or joules/particle, respectively), in a configuration file 
       (see '-c'). The format is (bond_type: monomer(s) involved: units involved: delta_g_298), for example:
           barriers_kcalmol = {oxidation: {'G': {monomer: 0.9, oligomer: 6.3}, 'S': {{{MONOMER}: 0.6, {OLIGOMER}: 2.2}}, ...}.
       The default output is a SMILES string printed to standard out.
     
       All command-line options may alternatively be specified in a configuration file. Command-line (non-default) 
       selections will override configuration file specifications.
     
    optional arguments:
       -h, --help            show this help message and exit
       -a ADD_RATES, --add_rates ADD_RATES
                             A comma-separated list of the rates of monomer addition to the system (in monomers/second), 
                             to be used when the 'max_num_monomers' ('-m' option) is larger than 'initial_num_monomers' 
                             ('-i' option), thus specifying monomer addition. The simulation will end when either there 
                             are no more possible reactions (including monomer addition) or when the 'length_simulation' 
                             ('-l' option) is reached, whichever comes first. Note: if there are spaces in the list of 
                             addition rates, the list must be enclosed in quotes to be read as a single string. The 
                             default list contains the single addition rate of 1.0 monomers/s.
       -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                             The location of the configuration file in the 'ini' format. This file can be used to 
                             overwrite default values such as for energies.
       -d OUT_DIR, --out_dir OUT_DIR
                             The directory where output files will be saved. The default is the current directory.
       -dy, --dynamics_flag  Select this option if dynamics (results per timestep) are requested. If chosen, plots of 
                             monomers and oligomers vs timestep, and bond type percent vs timestep, will be saved. 
                             They will be named 'bond_dist_v_step_*_#.png' and 'mono_olig_v_step_*_#.png', where * 
                             represents the S:G ratio and # represents the addition rate. Note that this option 
                             significantly increases simulation time.
       -e, --energy_barriers_flag
                             By default, the reaction rates will be based on the energy barriers in kcal/mol to be used 
                             to calculate reaction rates at 298.15 K. If this flag is used, the rates use to produce the 
                             original manuscript plots will be used (missing one term). Alternate sets of energy 
                             barriers can be specified; see the main help message.
       -f OUTPUT_FORMAT_LIST, --output_format_list OUTPUT_FORMAT_LIST
                             The type(s) of output format to be saved. Provide as a space- or comma-separated list. 
                             Note: if the list has spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes, to be treated as a single 
                             string. The currently supported types are: 'json', 'png', 'smi', 'svg', 'tcl'. 
                             The 'json' option will save a json format of RDKit's 'mol' (molecule) object. The 'tcl' 
                             option will create a file for use with VMD to generate a psf file and 3D molecules, 
                             as described in LigninBuilder, https://github.com/jvermaas/LigninBuilder, 
                             https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05665. 
                             A base name for the saved files can be provided with the '-o' option. Otherwise, the 
                             base name will be 'lignin-kmc-out'.
       -i INITIAL_NUM_MONOMERS, --initial_num_monomers INITIAL_NUM_MONOMERS
                             The initial number of monomers to be included in the simulation. The default is 2.
       -l LENGTH_SIMULATION, --length_simulation LENGTH_SIMULATION
                             The length of simulation (simulation time) in seconds. The default is 3600 s.
       -m MAX_NUM_MONOMERS, --max_num_monomers MAX_NUM_MONOMERS
                             The maximum number of monomers to be studied. The default value is 10.
       -n NUM_REPEATS, --num_repeats NUM_REPEATS
                             The number of times each combination of sg_ratio and add_rate will be tested. The default is 1.
       -o OUTPUT_BASENAME, --output_basename OUTPUT_BASENAME
                             The base name for output file(s). If an extension is provided, it will determine 
                             the type of output. Currently supported output types are: 
                             'json', 'png', 'smi', 'svg', 'tcl'. Multiple output formats can be selected with the 
                             '-f' option. If the '-f' option is selected and no output base name provided, a default 
                             base name of 'lignin-kmc-out' will be used.
       -p, --plot_bonds      Flag to produce plots of the percent of each bond type versus S:G ratio(s). One plot will 
                             be created per addition rate, named 'bond_dist_v_sg_#.png', where # represents 
                             the addition rate.
       -r RANDOM_SEED, --random_seed RANDOM_SEED
                             A positive integer to be used as a seed value for testing. The default is not to use a 
                             seed, to allow pseudorandom lignin creation.
       -s IMAGE_SIZE, --image_size IMAGE_SIZE
                             The output size of svg or png files in pixels. The default size is (1200, 300) pixels. 
                             To use a different size, provide two integers, separated by a space or a comma. 
                             Note: if the list of two numbers has any spaces in it, it must be enclosed in quotes.
       -sg SG_RATIOS, --sg_ratios SG_RATIOS
                             A comma-separated list of the S:G (guaiacol:syringyl) ratios to be tested. 
                             If there are spaces, the list must be enclosed in quotes to be read as a single string. 
                             The default list contains the single value 1.
       -t TEMPERATURE_IN_K, --temperature_in_k TEMPERATURE_IN_K
                             The temperature (in K) at which to model lignin biosynthesis. The default is 298.15 K.
                             Note: this temperature must match the temperature at which the energy barriers were calculated. 
       --chain_id CHAIN_ID   Option for use when generating a tcl script: the chainID to be used in generating a psf 
                             and/or pdb file from a tcl script (see LigninBuilder). This should be one character. If a 
                             longer ID is provided, it will be truncated to the first character. The default value is L.
       --psf_fname PSF_FNAME
                             Option for use when generating a tcl script: the file name for psf and pdb files that will 
                             be produced from running a tcl produced by this package (see LigninBuilder). The default 
                             value is lignin.
       --toppar_dir TOPPAR_DIR
                             Option for use when generating a tcl script: the directory name where VMD should look for 
                             the toppar file(s) when running the tcl file in VMD (see LigninBuilder). The default value 
                             is 'toppar/'.

For example, to use an S to G ratio of 2.5, 12 initial monomers, and up to 18 monomers, with the remaining variables 
left as their default values, enter:

 `> create_lignin -sg 2.5 -i 12 -m 18`

Note: a simulation may not reach the maximum number of monomers if there is insufficient simulation time. The 
simulation stops when either the length_simulation is reached or there are no more possible reactions, whichever 
happens first.

### Developer Use

Navigate to the directory where you would like the local copy of the source code to exist, and then clone the 
repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/michaelorella/lignin-kmc
```

In the root, you will find a file titled `environment.yml`. This file contains all of the dependencies listed above 
plus two additional packages required for testing (pytest and joblib), with the versions tested. To create your own 
environment mirroring this one, run the following command in the terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows):

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Once the environment has been created, activate it:

```
conda activate lignin_kmc
```

Congratulations! Lignin-KMC is now installed! With this basic installation, you will have access to the functions 
therein (such as `run_kmc`, `generate_mol`, and `analyze_adj_matrix`) and the classes `Monomer` and `Event`.

## Examples
For examples, see `LigninPolymerizationNotebook.ipynb`, `Example.ipynb`, and `Dynamics.ipynb`. 

## API Reference

### kmc_common.py

#### CLASSES

__Event__(key, index, rate, bond)
- key = str = name of the event that is taking place (e.g. '5o4', 'ox', etc.)
- index = [int, int] = list of indices to the monomers that are affected by this event
- rate = float = the rate of the event that is occurring (units consistent with time units in simulation)
- bond = [int, int] = list of changes that need to be made to the adjacency matrix to perform the event

The class that is used to define events, which can be unpacked by the `run` function to execute the events occurring in 
the simulation.

__Monomer__(type, index)
- type = str, limited to S, G, or C = indicates the monomer type. This class can be extended to include more monomer 
  types.
- index = int = a number that should be unique for all monomers in a simulation. This is returned as the hash value and 
  is used to track individual subunits in the adjacency matrix.

The class that contains information about each monomer in the simulation, most importantly tracking the index and the 
monomer type.


### kmc_functions.py

#### FUNCTIONS

__find_fragments__(adj)
- adj = dok_matrix = NxN sparse matrix in the dictionary of keys format
- return = [{}, {}, ..., {}], [int, int, ..., int] = list of sets of connected components within the adjacency matrix 
and a list of ints containing the number of number of branch points found in each fragment.

Identifies connected component subgraphs of the supergraph `adj`, which can be used to determine yields or identify 
whether two monomers are connected.

__fragment_size__(frags)
- frags = [{},{},...,{}] = list of sets as returned from `find_fragments`
- return = dict() = dictionary mapping all of the indices in frags to the length of the fragment they were contained in

Gets the sizes for all of the monomers in the simulation

__quick_frag_size__(monomer)
- monomer = Monomer = instance of monomer object that we want to check
- return = str = 'monomer' or 'oligomer' 

Uses the open positions attribute of the monomer object to determine whether there is anything connected to this monomer yet

__break_bond_type__(adj, bond_type)
- adj = scipy dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- bond_type = str = the bond that should be broken
- return = dok_matrix = new adjacency matrix after bonds were broken

Modifies the adjacency matrix to reflect certain bonds specified by `bond_type` being broken. This is used primarily 
when we are evaluating the effect that reductive cleavage treatment would have on the simulated lignin. As of now, 
all bonds of a given type are removed without discrimination.

__count_bonds__(adj)
- adj = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- return = OrderedDict = a dictionary containing all bond strings mapped to the number of times they occur within `adj`

Used for evaluating the frequency of different linkages within a simulated lignin

__count_oligomer_yields__(adj)
- adj = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- return = OrderedDict, dict, dict, dict = maps the size of an oligomer to:
     the number of occurrences within the adjacency matrix, 
     the total number of monomers involved in oligomers,
     total number of branch points in oligomers of that length, and
     the branching coefficient for the oligomers of that length

Used to count the yields of monomers, dimers, etc., when the simulation is complete.

__analyze_adj_matrix__(adjacency)
- adjacency = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- return = dict() = maps different measurable quantities to their values predicted from the simulation

Aggregates analysis of oligomer length and bond types, and these same properties post C-O bond cleavage.

__update_events__(monomers, adj, last_event, events, rate_vec, rate_dict, max_mon=500)
- state_dict = dict() = maps the index of the monomer to the object and the events that a change to this index would effect
- adj = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- last_event = Event = the previous event that occurred
- event_dict = dict() = map the hash value of each event to the unique event - this is all of the possible events at the 
  current state after the method is run
- rate_vec = dict() = map the hash value of each event to the rate of that event
- rate_dict = dict() = the reaction rates for all possible reactions, in  monomer/second
- max_mon = int = the maximum number of monomers in the simulation
- return = None

Mutates the dictionary of events and rateVec that are passed to the function. These mutations are done so that the 
entire state doesn't need to be reconstructed on every iteration of the simulation. Once these changes are made, the 
event choice is ready to be made and the chosen event can be performed.

__do_event__(event, state, adj, sg_ratio=None, random_seed=None)
- event = Event = the event that was chosen to be performed
- state = dict() = the dictionary mapping monomer indices to the monomer object and events that would be changed by a 
  change to the monomer
- adj = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- sg_ratio = float needed if and only if: a) there are S and G and only S and G, and b) new monomers will be added
- random_seed = int (positive val) needed if repeatable results are desired (for testing)

Updates the monomers and adjacency matrix to reflect the execution of the chosen event

__run_kmc__(rate_dict, initial_state, initial_events, n_max=10, t_max=10, dynamics=False, random_seed=None)
- rate_dict:  dict -- the rate of each of the possible events as a 3-d dictionary mapping bond type, monomers sizes,  
                      and monomer types to a rate in units consistent with your final time definition
- initial_state: dict  -- The dictionary mapping the index of each monomer to a dictionary with the monomer
-      and the set of events that a change to this monomer would impact
- initial_events: dictionary -- The dictionary mapping event hash values to those events
- n_max: int   -- The maximum number of monomers in the simulation
- t_max: float -- The final simulation time (units depend on units of rates; seconds if using the default rates)
- dynamics: boolean -- if True, will keep values for every time step
- random_seed: None or hashable value to aid testing
- return: dict with the simulation times, adjacency matrix, and list of monomers at the end of the simulation

Runs the Gillespie algorithm on the situation specified by the parameters. This is the workhorse of the code, where the 
monomers are changed and linked to simulate the growth of lignin *in planta*.

__generate_mol__(adj, node_list)
- adj = dok_matrix = adjacency matrix
- nodeList = [Monomer, Monomer, ..., Monomer] = list of monomers output from the simulation
- return = str = molfile contents

Generates a file format as specified by [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) that represents the molecule that was just simulated 
by `run_kmc`. This file can then be used together with rdKit for further visualization or analysis, or any one of your 
favorite chemical drawing software packages.
