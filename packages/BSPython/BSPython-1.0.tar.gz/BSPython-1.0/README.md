# BSPy

This project attempts to make the Bulk-Synchronous parallel (BSP) model
available in Python. This model, first described by Leslie G. Valiant
is designed to be an efficient model for parallel computation while also
promising to keep complexity analysis relatively simple.

## How to use BSPy
**Documentation -** http://mitchellfaas.com/BSPy/index.html

BSPy has digressed from the original standard to accommodate a more pythonic
way of programming. Everyone is therefore urged to peruse the documentation.
Those already familiar with BSP will likely only need to read up on the
available functions and their syntax. For everyone else, a tutorial section
is available.
