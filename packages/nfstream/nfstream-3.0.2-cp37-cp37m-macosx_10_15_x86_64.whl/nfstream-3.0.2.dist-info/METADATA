Main features
=============

* **Performance:** **nfstream** is designed to be fast (x10 faster with pypy3 support) with a small CPU and memory footprint.
* **Layer-7 visibility:** **nfstream** deep packet inspection engine is based on nDPI_ library. It allows nfstream to perform reliable_ encrypted applications identification and metadata extraction (e.g. TLS, SSH, DNS, HTTP).
* **Flexibility:** add a flow feature in 2 lines as an NFPlugin_.
* **Machine Learning oriented:** add your trained model as an NFPlugin_.

How to use it?
==============

* Dealing with a big pcap file and just want to aggregate it as network flows? **nfstream** make this path easier in few lines:

.. code-block:: python

   from nfstream import NFStreamer
   my_awesome_streamer = NFStreamer(source="facebook.pcap") # or capture from a network interface (source="eth0")
   for flow in my_awesome_streamer:
       print(flow)  # print, append to pandas Dataframe or whatever you want :)!


.. code-block:: python

    NFEntry(
        flow_id=0,
        first_seen=1472393122365,
        last_seen=1472393123665,
        version=4,
        src_port=52066,
        dst_port=443,
        protocol=6,
        vlan_id=0,
        src_ip='192.168.43.18',
        dst_ip='66.220.156.68',
        total_packets=19,
        total_bytes=5745,
        duration=1300,
        src2dst_packets=9,
        src2dst_bytes=1345,
        dst2src_packets=10,
        dst2src_bytes=4400,
        expiration_id=0,
        master_protocol=91,
        app_protocol=119,
        application_name='TLS.Facebook',
        category_name='SocialNetwork',
        client_info='facebook.com',
        server_info='*.facebook.com',
        j3a_client='bfcc1a3891601edb4f137ab7ab25b840',
        j3a_server='2d1eb5817ece335c24904f516ad5da12'
    )

* Didn't find a specific flow feature? add a plugin to **nfstream** in few lines:

.. code-block:: python

    from nfstream import NFPlugin

    class my_awesome_plugin(NFPlugin):
        def on_update(self, obs, entry):
            if obs.length >= 666:
                entry.my_awesome_plugin += 1

   streamer_awesome = NFStreamer(source='devil.pcap', plugins=[my_awesome_plugin()])
   for flow in streamer_awesome:
      print(flow.my_awesome_plugin) # now you will see your dynamically created metric in generated flows


* More example and details are provided on the official Documentation_.
