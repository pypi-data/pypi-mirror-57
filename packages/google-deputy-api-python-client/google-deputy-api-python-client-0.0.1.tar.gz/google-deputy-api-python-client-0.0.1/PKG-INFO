Description: # Deputy API Python Client
        
        This is a Python3 client library for interacting with the
        [Deputy.com api](https://www.deputy.com/api-doc/API/Getting_Started).
        
        At best, it allows one to easily transcribe responses from the API into Python 
        objects. At worst, it simplifies building and making queries to the API in a 
        more object-oriented way.
        
        This is not an official, or supported, Google product.
