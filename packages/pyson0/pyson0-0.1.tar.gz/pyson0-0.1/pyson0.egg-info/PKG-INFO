        ## Status
        ![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lbragues/pyson0.svg?branch=master)
        #
        At the moment some parts of the library are not complete and others need validations in terms of use cases and performance.
        
        ### json0
        For now the port is only implementing the apply **without** support for si/sd.
        We will be adding this in the near future.
        
        ### json0-ot-diff
        It is fully ported. To support string operations it is using the python diff-match-patch implementation from google.
