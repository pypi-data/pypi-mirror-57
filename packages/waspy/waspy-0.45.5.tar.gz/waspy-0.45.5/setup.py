You should be able to call other services in different languages\nassuming they all follow the same patterns. This framework has a pluggable\narchitecture for the transport layer, which allows you to switch from\nhttp to using a message bus, or vice-versa. You could even listen on both\nat the same time without having to modify your code at all.\n\n## Example\nLook at `examples/` folder for some quick examples, or there is an entire example repo at https://github.com/wasp/waspy-example\n\n## Alpha\nThis project is currently in alpha state. \nThere are a lot of features missing.\n\nFeatures for beta:\n- [x] HTTP Transport\n- [x] Routing\n- [x] RabbitMQ transporty\n- [x] Support middlewares\n- [x] Client library (for calling other services)\n- [x] HTTP client transport (with envvar service discovery)\n- [x] RabbitMQ client transport\n- [ ] Test everything\n\nnote: all alpha features are complete, but I am still in the process of adding more robusts tests. Until that is done, waspy will remain in alpha and api\'s might change.\n \nWish List:\n- [ ] Transport classes for nats (nats.io)\n- [ ] Transport classes for kafka\n- [ ] Transport classes for gRPC \n- [ ] pattern for synchronous "worker-tier"\n- [x] configuration package\n- [ ] auto-reloading when in debug mode\n- [x] sentry integration\n- [ ] jwt handling\n\nFeatures for GA (1.0):\n- [ ] High level "Falcon-like" api for writing RESTFUL endpoints even easier!\n- [ ] High level can be overridden by lower level for control/performance reasons\n- [ ] Stable/proven API\n\n## License\nApache-2.0\n\n## Installing\nTo install, just run `pip install waspy`\n\n## Developing\n`python setup.py develop`\n',
