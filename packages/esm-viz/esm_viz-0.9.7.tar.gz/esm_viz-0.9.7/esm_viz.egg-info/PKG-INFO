        First Steps
        -----------
        
        The easiest way to get started is:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ esm_viz --help
        
        This will display a series of options you can use. In order to set up automatic monitoring for an experiment, you can use ``esm_viz template``
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        For AWI Users
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        On ``paleosrv1.awi.de``; the software is already installed. 
        
        
        For Other Users
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        There are several external packages that need to be installed in order for everything to work correctly. The easiest way to get everything in one go is:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install esm_viz
            
        You can then type 
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ esm_viz configure
        
        This will ask open up a configuration file for you to edit.
        
        Usage Demonstration
        -------------------
        
        Interactively setting up a new monitoring job:
        
        .. code-block:: console
            
            $ esm_viz
            
        Setting up a monitoring job from a YAML file:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ esm_viz </PATH/TO/EXPERIMENT.yaml>
        
        Setting up a monitoring job from a YAML file already stored in ``${HOME}/.config/monitoring``
        
        .. code-block:: console
            
            $ esm_viz EXPERIMENT
            
        .. note::
            The ``.yaml`` extension is appended automatically!
            
        Performing only certain parts of a job:
        
        .. code-block:: console
            
            $ # Only schedule a job to run every 2 hours:
            $ esm_viz schedule EXPERIMENT
            $ # Schedule a job to run every 6 hours:
            $ esm_viz schedule --frequency 6 EXPERIMENT
            $ # Deploying monitoring scripts and running them on the supercomputer
            $ # Note that the scripts actually run depend on the configuration file
            $ esm_viz deploy EXPERIMENT
            $ # Combining results into a webpage
            $ esm_viz combine EXPERIMENT
        
        
        In the next section, the command line interface and python modules are explained in more detail. Then, we show an explanation about how to customize what is shown in the plots.

        History
        =======
        
        Upcoming 0.9.6
        --------------
        
        * Py2/Py3 agnostic ``FileNotFoundError``
        
        * SSH Key generation
        
        * Installing with ``pip -v`` gives you a message about PATH and PYTHONPATH.
          However, the ``-v`` is **required** for this to show up. See here:
          https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2933
        
        0.9.5 (2019-09-16)
        ------------------
        Install seems to work for Chris. Dependencies still need to be more tightly controlled.
        
        0.9.4 (2019-09-14)
        ------------------
        Lots of changes since the last update. **Missing history**, sorry. Version
        ``0.10.0`` planned onces Christopher can monitor a job.
        
        
        0.3.0 (2019-04-12)
        ------------------
        Monitoring update to include ECHAM Global Timeseries
        
        0.1.1 (2019-04-08)
        ------------------
        Happy birthday to Paul!
        
        * Most of general analysis works for SLURM; only tested by Paul. PBS Queues are
          in principle possible, but untested. This should be expanded.
        
        0.1.0 (2019-03-23)
        ------------------
        
        * Start of project in this repository. It has other history; but that is
          undocumented. See the proxy records...
