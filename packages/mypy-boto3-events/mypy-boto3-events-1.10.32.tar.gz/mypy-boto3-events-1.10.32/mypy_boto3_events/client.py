        Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source.

        .. note::

          This operation is not used by AWS customers.

        Each partner event source can be used by one AWS account to create a matching partner event
        bus in that AWS account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source for each AWS
        account that wants to receive those event types.

        A partner event source creates events based on resources in the SaaS partner's service or
        application.

        An AWS account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner event source can
        use that event bus to receive events from the partner, and then process them using AWS
        Events rules and targets.

        Partner event source names follow this format:

         ``aws.partner/*partner_name* /*event_namespace* /*event_name* ``

        * *partner_name* is determined during partner registration and identifies the partner to AWS
        customers.

        * For *event_namespace* , we recommend that partners use a string that identifies the AWS
        customer within the partner's system. This should not be the customer's AWS account ID.

        * *event_name* is determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify an
        event-generating resource within the partner system. This should help AWS customers decide
        whether to create an event bus to receive these events.

            - **Targets** *(list) --*

              The targets assigned to the rule.

              - *(dict) --*

                Targets are the resources to be invoked when a rule is triggered. For a complete
                list of services and resources that can be set as a target, see  PutTargets .

                If you're setting the event bus of another account as the target and that account
                granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by
                the account ID, you must specify a ``RoleArn`` with proper permissions in the
                ``Target`` structure. For more information, see `Sending and Receiving Events
                Between AWS Accounts
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html>`__
                in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .

                - **Id** *(string) --*

                  A name for the target. Use a string that will help you identify the target. Each
                  target associated with a rule must have an ``Id`` unique for that rule.

                - **Arn** *(string) --*

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target.

                - **RoleArn** *(string) --*

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be used for this target when the
                  rule is triggered. If one rule triggers multiple targets, you can use a different
                  IAM role for each target.

                - **Input** *(string) --*

                  Valid JSON text passed to the target. In this case, nothing from the event itself
                  is passed to the target. For more information, see `The JavaScript Object Notation
                  (JSON) Data Interchange Format <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt>`__ .

                - **InputPath** *(string) --*

                  The value of the JSONPath that is used for extracting part of the matched event
                  when passing it to the target. You must use JSON dot notation, not bracket
                  notation. For more information about JSON paths, see `JSONPath
                  <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>`__ .

                - **InputTransformer** *(dict) --*

                  Settings to enable you to provide custom input to a target based on certain event
                  data. You can extract one or more key-value pairs from the event and then use that
                  data to send customized input to the target.

                  - **InputPathsMap** *(dict) --*

                    Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can then insert these in
                    the template in ``InputTemplate`` to produce the output to be sent to the
                    target.

                     ``InputPathsMap`` is an array key-value pairs, where each value is a valid JSON
                     path. You can have as many as 10 key-value pairs. You must use JSON dot
                     notation, not bracket notation.

                    The keys can't start with ``"AWS"`` .

                      - *(string) --*

                  - **InputTemplate** *(string) --*

                    Input template where you specify placeholders that will be filled with the
                    values of the keys from ``InputPathsMap`` to customize the data sent to the
                    target. Enclose each ``InputPathsMaps`` value in brackets: <*value* >. The
                    InputTemplate must be valid JSON.

                    If ``InputTemplate`` is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the
                    following restrictions apply:

                    * The placeholder can't be used as an object key

                    * Object values can't include quote marks

                    The following example shows the syntax for using ``InputPathsMap`` and
                    ``InputTemplate`` .

                     ``"InputTransformer":``

                     ``{``

                     ``"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status":
                     "$.detail.status"},``

                     ``"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state <status>"``

                     ``}``

                    To have the ``InputTemplate`` include quote marks within a JSON string, escape
                    each quote marks with a slash, as in the following example:

                     ``"InputTransformer":``

                     ``{``

                     ``"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status":
                     "$.detail.status"},``

                     ``"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state \\"<status>\\""``

                     ``}``

                - **KinesisParameters** *(dict) --*

                  The custom parameter that you can use to control the shard assignment when the
                  target is a Kinesis data stream. If you don't include this parameter, the default

                - **RunCommandParameters** *(dict) --*

                  Parameters used when you are using the rule to invoke Amazon EC2 Run Command.

                  - **RunCommandTargets** *(list) --*

                    Currently, we support including only one ``RunCommandTarget`` block, which
                    specifies either an array of ``InstanceIds`` or a tag.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      Information about the EC2 instances that are to be sent the command, specified
                      as key-value pairs. Each ``RunCommandTarget`` block can include only one key,
                      but this key can specify multiple values.

                      - **Key** *(string) --*

                        Can be either ``tag:``  *tag-key* or ``InstanceIds`` .

                      - **Values** *(list) --*

                        If ``Key`` is ``tag:``  *tag-key* , ``Values`` is a list of tag values. If
                        ``Key`` is ``InstanceIds`` , ``Values`` is a list of Amazon EC2 instance
                        IDs.

                        - *(string) --*

                - **EcsParameters** *(dict) --*

                  Contains the Amazon ECS task definition and task count to be used if the event
                  target is an Amazon ECS task. For more information about Amazon ECS tasks, see
                  `Task Definitions
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html>`__
                  in the *Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide* .

                  - **TaskDefinitionArn** *(string) --*

                    The ARN of the task definition to use if the event target is an Amazon ECS task.

                  - **TaskCount** *(integer) --*

                    The number of tasks to create based on ``TaskDefinition`` . The default is 1.

                  - **LaunchType** *(string) --*

                    Specifies the launch type on which your task is running. The launch type that
                    you specify here must match one of the launch type (compatibilities) of the
                    target task. The ``FARGATE`` value is supported only in the Regions where AWS
                    Fargate with Amazon ECS is supported. For more information, see `AWS Fargate on
                    Amazon ECS
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS-Fargate.html>`__
                    in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                  - **NetworkConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                    Use this structure if the ECS task uses the ``awsvpc`` network mode. This
                    structure specifies the VPC subnets and security groups associated with the task
                    and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is required if
                    ``LaunchType`` is ``FARGATE`` because the ``awsvpc`` mode is required for
                    Fargate tasks.

                    If you specify ``NetworkConfiguration`` when the target ECS task doesn't use the
                    ``awsvpc`` network mode, the task fails.

                    - **awsvpcConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                      Use this structure to specify the VPC subnets and security groups for the task
                      and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is relevant only
                      for ECS tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode.

                      - **Subnets** *(list) --*

                        Specifies the subnets associated with the task. These subnets must all be in
                        the same VPC. You can specify as many as 16 subnets.

                      - **SecurityGroups** *(list) --*

                        Specifies the security groups associated with the task. These security
                        groups must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as five security
                        groups. If you don't specify a security group, the default security group
                        for the VPC is used.

                        - *(string) --*

                      - **AssignPublicIp** *(string) --*

                        Specifies whether the task's elastic network interface receives a public IP
                        address. You can specify ``ENABLED`` only when ``LaunchType`` in
                        ``EcsParameters`` is set to ``FARGATE`` .

                  - **PlatformVersion** *(string) --*

                    Specifies the platform version for the task. Specify only the numeric portion of
                    the platform version, such as ``1.1.0`` .

                    This structure is used only if ``LaunchType`` is ``FARGATE`` . For more
                    information about valid platform versions, see `AWS Fargate Platform Versions
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__
                    in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

                  - **Group** *(string) --*

                    Specifies an ECS task group for the task. The maximum length is 255 characters.

                - **BatchParameters** *(dict) --*

                  If the event target is an AWS Batch job, this contains the job definition, job
                  name, and other parameters. For more information, see `Jobs
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/jobs.html>`__ in the *AWS
                  Batch User Guide* .

                  - **JobDefinition** *(string) --*

                    The ARN or name of the job definition to use if the event target is an AWS Batch
                    job. This job definition must already exist.

                  - **JobName** *(string) --*

                    The name to use for this execution of the job, if the target is an AWS Batch
                    job.

                  - **ArrayProperties** *(dict) --*

                    The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the array. The
                    array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array properties for a
                    job, it becomes an array job. This parameter is used only if the target is an
                    AWS Batch job.

                    - **Size** *(integer) --*

                      The size of the array, if this is an array batch job. Valid values are
                      integers between 2 and 10,000.

                  - **RetryStrategy** *(dict) --*

                    The retry strategy to use for failed jobs if the target is an AWS Batch job. The
                    retry strategy is the number of times to retry the failed job execution. Valid
                    values are 1–10. When you specify a retry strategy here, it overrides the retry
                    strategy defined in the job definition.

                    - **Attempts** *(integer) --*

                      The number of times to attempt to retry, if the job fails. Valid values are
                      1–10.

                - **SqsParameters** *(dict) --*

                  Contains the message group ID to use when the target is a FIFO queue.

                  If you specify an SQS FIFO queue as a target, the queue must have content-based
                  deduplication enabled.

                  - **MessageGroupId** *(string) --*

                    The FIFO message group ID to use as the target.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

        :param Action: **[REQUIRED]**

          The action that you're enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be

        :param Principal: **[REQUIRED]**

          The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event
          bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.

          If you specify "*" without specifying ``Condition`` , avoid creating rules that might
          match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern
          for each rule contains an ``account`` field with a specific account ID to receive events
          from. Rules that have an account field match events sent only from accounts that are
          listed in the rule's ``account`` field.

        :type StatementId: string
        :param StatementId: **[REQUIRED]**

          An identifier string for the external account that you're granting permissions to. If you
          later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this
          ``StatementId`` when you run  RemovePermission .

        :type Condition: dict
        :param Condition:

          This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that fulfill a certain
          condition, such as being a member of a certain AWS organization. For more information
          about AWS Organizations, see `What Is AWS Organizations?
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html>`__ in
          the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

          If you specify ``Condition`` with an AWS organization ID and specify "*" as the value for
          ``Principal`` , you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.

          The ``Condition`` is a JSON string that must contain ``Type`` , ``Key`` , and ``Value``
          fields.

          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The type of condition. Currently, the only supported value is ``StringEquals`` .

          - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The key for the condition. Currently, the only supported key is ``aws:PrincipalOrgID`` .

          - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The value for the key. Currently, this must be the ID of the organization.

        Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default or based on value of the
        state. You can disable a rule using  DisableRule .

        A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by AWS services
        go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or
        applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or
        services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom
        event bus that you have created. For more information, see  CreateEventBus .

        If you're updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this
        ``PutRule`` command. If you omit arguments in ``PutRule`` , the old values for those
        arguments aren't kept. Instead, they're replaced with null values.

        When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to
        new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

        A rule must contain at least an ``EventPattern`` or ``ScheduleExpression`` . Rules with
        ``EventPatterns`` are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with
        ``ScheduleExpressions`` self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an
        ``EventPattern`` and a ``ScheduleExpression`` , in which case the rule triggers on matching
        events as well as on a schedule.

        When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule.
        Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope
        user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain
        tag values. To use the ``PutRule`` operation and assign tags, you must have both the
        ``events:PutRule`` and ``events:TagResource`` permissions.

        If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the ``PutRule`` operation are
        ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use  TagResource and  UntagResource .

        Most services in AWS treat ``:`` or ``/`` as the same character in Amazon Resource Names
        (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use
        the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in
        the event that you want to match.

        In EventBridge, you could create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired
        repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and
        trigger software to change them to the desired state. If you don't write the rule carefully,
        the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.

        To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don't refire the same rule.
        For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of
        after any change.

        An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use
        budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information,
        see `Managing Your Costs with Budgets

        Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they're already
        associated with the rule.

        Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.

        You can configure the following as targets in EventBridge:

        * EC2 instances

        * SSM Run Command

        * SSM Automation

        * AWS Lambda functions

        * Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

        * Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

        * Amazon ECS tasks

        * AWS Step Functions state machines

        * AWS Batch jobs

        * AWS CodeBuild projects

        * Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline

        * Amazon Inspector assessment templates

        * Amazon SNS topics

        * Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues

        * The default event bus of another AWS account

        Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only on the AWS Management Console. The
        built-in targets are ``EC2 CreateSnapshot API call`` , ``EC2 RebootInstances API call`` ,
        ``EC2 StopInstances API call`` , and ``EC2 TerminateInstances API call`` .

        For some target types, ``PutTargets`` provides target-specific parameters. If the target is
        a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the
        ``KinesisParameters`` argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule,
        you can use the ``RunCommandParameters`` field.

        To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs
        the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on
        resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions
        state machines, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the ``RoleARN`` argument
        in ``PutTargets`` . For more information, see `Authentication and Access Control
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html>`__
        in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .

        If another AWS account is in the same Region and has granted you permission (using
        ``PutPermission`` ), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a
        target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account,
        specify that account's event bus as the ``Arn`` value when you run ``PutTargets`` . If your
        account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each
        event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
        isn't charged. For more information, see `Amazon EventBridge Pricing
        <https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/>`__ .

        If you're setting an event bus in another account as the target and that account granted
        permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID,
        you must specify a ``RoleArn`` with proper permissions in the ``Target`` structure. For more
        information, see `Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html>`__
        in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .

        For more information about enabling cross-account events, see  PutPermission .

         ``Input`` , ``InputPath`` , and ``InputTransformer`` are mutually exclusive and optional
         parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:

        * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, the entire event is passed
        to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS
        task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).

        * If ``Input`` is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden
        with this constant.

        * If ``InputPath`` is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, ``$.detail`` ), only
        the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the
        detail part of the event is passed).

        * If ``InputTransformer`` is specified, one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from
        the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.

        When you specify ``InputPath`` or ``InputTransformer`` , you must use JSON dot notation, not
        bracket notation.

        When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated
        targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take
        effect.

        This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that
        happens, ``FailedEntryCount`` is nonzero in the response, and each entry in
        ``FailedEntries`` provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

              Data Interchange Format <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt>`__ .

            - **InputPath** *(string) --*

              The value of the JSONPath that is used for extracting part of the matched event when
              passing it to the target. You must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. For
              more information about JSON paths, see `JSONPath
              <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>`__ .

            - **InputTransformer** *(dict) --*

              Settings to enable you to provide custom input to a target based on certain event
              data. You can extract one or more key-value pairs from the event and then use that
              data to send customized input to the target.

              - **InputPathsMap** *(dict) --*

                Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can then insert these in the
                template in ``InputTemplate`` to produce the output to be sent to the target.

                 ``InputPathsMap`` is an array key-value pairs, where each value is a valid JSON
                 path. You can have as many as 10 key-value pairs. You must use JSON dot notation,
                 not bracket notation.

                The keys can't start with ``"AWS"`` .

                - *(string) --*

                  - *(string) --*

              - **InputTemplate** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                Input template where you specify placeholders that will be filled with the values of
                the keys from ``InputPathsMap`` to customize the data sent to the target. Enclose
                each ``InputPathsMaps`` value in brackets: <*value* >. The InputTemplate must be
                valid JSON.

                If ``InputTemplate`` is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the following
                restrictions apply:

                * The placeholder can't be used as an object key

                * Object values can't include quote marks

                The following example shows the syntax for using ``InputPathsMap`` and
                ``InputTemplate`` .

                 ``"InputTransformer":``

                 ``{``

                 ``"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},``

                 ``"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state <status>"``

                 ``}``

                To have the ``InputTemplate`` include quote marks within a JSON string, escape each
                quote marks with a slash, as in the following example:

                 ``"InputTransformer":``

                 ``{``

                 ``"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},``

                 ``"InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state \\"<status>\\""``

                 ``}``

            - **KinesisParameters** *(dict) --*

              The custom parameter that you can use to control the shard assignment when the target
              is a Kinesis data stream. If you don't include this parameter, the default is to use
              the ``eventId`` as the partition key.

              - **PartitionKeyPath** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The JSON path to be extracted from the event and used as the partition key. For more
                information, see `Amazon Kinesis Streams Key Concepts
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html#partition-key>`__
                in the *Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide* .

            - **RunCommandParameters** *(dict) --*

              Parameters used when you are using the rule to invoke Amazon EC2 Run Command.

              - **RunCommandTargets** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                Currently, we support including only one ``RunCommandTarget`` block, which specifies
                either an array of ``InstanceIds`` or a tag.

                - *(dict) --*

                  Information about the EC2 instances that are to be sent the command, specified as
                  key-value pairs. Each ``RunCommandTarget`` block can include only one key, but
                  this key can specify multiple values.

                  - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Can be either ``tag:``  *tag-key* or ``InstanceIds`` .

                  - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    If ``Key`` is ``tag:``  *tag-key* , ``Values`` is a list of tag values. If
                    ``Key`` is ``InstanceIds`` , ``Values`` is a list of Amazon EC2 instance IDs.

                    - *(string) --*

            - **EcsParameters** *(dict) --*

              Contains the Amazon ECS task definition and task count to be used if the event target
              is an Amazon ECS task. For more information about Amazon ECS tasks, see `Task
              Definitions
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html>`__
              in the *Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide* .

              - **TaskDefinitionArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The ARN of the task definition to use if the event target is an Amazon ECS task.

              - **TaskCount** *(integer) --*

                The number of tasks to create based on ``TaskDefinition`` . The default is 1.

              - **LaunchType** *(string) --*

                Specifies the launch type on which your task is running. The launch type that you
                specify here must match one of the launch type (compatibilities) of the target task.
                The ``FARGATE`` value is supported only in the Regions where AWS Fargate with Amazon
                ECS is supported. For more information, see `AWS Fargate on Amazon ECS
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS-Fargate.html>`__ in
                the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

              - **NetworkConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                Use this structure if the ECS task uses the ``awsvpc`` network mode. This structure
                specifies the VPC subnets and security groups associated with the task and whether a
                public IP address is to be used. This structure is required if ``LaunchType`` is
                ``FARGATE`` because the ``awsvpc`` mode is required for Fargate tasks.

                If you specify ``NetworkConfiguration`` when the target ECS task doesn't use the
                ``awsvpc`` network mode, the task fails.

                - **awsvpcConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                  Use this structure to specify the VPC subnets and security groups for the task and
                  whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is relevant only for ECS
                  tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode.

                  - **Subnets** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Specifies the subnets associated with the task. These subnets must all be in the
                    same VPC. You can specify as many as 16 subnets.

                    - *(string) --*

                  - **SecurityGroups** *(list) --*

                    Specifies the security groups associated with the task. These security groups
                    must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as five security groups. If
                    you don't specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is
                    used.

                    - *(string) --*

                  - **AssignPublicIp** *(string) --*

                    Specifies whether the task's elastic network interface receives a public IP
                    address. You can specify ``ENABLED`` only when ``LaunchType`` in
                    ``EcsParameters`` is set to ``FARGATE`` .

              - **PlatformVersion** *(string) --*

                Specifies the platform version for the task. Specify only the numeric portion of the
                platform version, such as ``1.1.0`` .

                This structure is used only if ``LaunchType`` is ``FARGATE`` . For more information
                about valid platform versions, see `AWS Fargate Platform Versions
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`__
                in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .

              - **Group** *(string) --*

                Specifies an ECS task group for the task. The maximum length is 255 characters.

            - **BatchParameters** *(dict) --*

              If the event target is an AWS Batch job, this contains the job definition, job name,
              and other parameters. For more information, see `Jobs
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/jobs.html>`__ in the *AWS Batch
              User Guide* .

              - **JobDefinition** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The ARN or name of the job definition to use if the event target is an AWS Batch
                job. This job definition must already exist.

              - **JobName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                The name to use for this execution of the job, if the target is an AWS Batch job.

              - **ArrayProperties** *(dict) --*

                The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the array. The array
                size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array properties for a job, it
                becomes an array job. This parameter is used only if the target is an AWS Batch job.

                - **Size** *(integer) --*

                  The size of the array, if this is an array batch job. Valid values are integers
                  between 2 and 10,000.

              - **RetryStrategy** *(dict) --*

                The retry strategy to use for failed jobs if the target is an AWS Batch job. The
                retry strategy is the number of times to retry the failed job execution. Valid
                values are 1–10. When you specify a retry strategy here, it overrides the retry
                strategy defined in the job definition.

                - **Attempts** *(integer) --*

                  The number of times to attempt to retry, if the job fails. Valid values are 1–10.

            - **SqsParameters** *(dict) --*

              Contains the message group ID to use when the target is a FIFO queue.

              If you specify an SQS FIFO queue as a target, the queue must have content-based
              deduplication enabled.

              - **MessageGroupId** *(string) --*

                The FIFO message group ID to use as the target.
