Description: # djspa
        Django addon for a single page application with dynamically loaded pages
        
        ## Installation
        Use the python package manager pip to install djutils.
        
        ```bash
        pip install djspa
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Add 'djspa' to INSTALLED_APPS at the end
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'djspa',
        ]
        ```
        
        Mark your BasePage (Template Class from that all other templates inherit) with the
        @set_baseview decorator of djspa
        
        ```python
        from django.views import generic
        from djspa import set_baseview
        
        @set_baseview
        class BaseView(generic.TemplateView):
            def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
                context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
                context['my_global_template_variable'] = 42
                return context
        ```
        
        Define your dynamic pages by a class, which inherits from your BaseView and the PageMixin.
        You have to set at least the `name` property, which is the name of the template and also the url.
        
        Import the djspa urlpatterns after you defined all views
        `from djspa.urls import urlpatterns # pylint:disable=C0411; urlpatterns of djspa MUST be loaded after all view definitions`
        
        You have to define at least the index page, otherwise you get an endless redirect loop.
        ```python
        from djspa import PageMixin
        
        class Index(BaseView, PageMixin):
            name = 'index'
        ```
        
        Include the pages snippet in your index page template
        ```
        {% include 'djspa_pages.html' %}
        ```
