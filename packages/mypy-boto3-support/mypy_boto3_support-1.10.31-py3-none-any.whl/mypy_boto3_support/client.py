        you to specify the following information:

        * **issueType.** The type of issue for the case. You can specify either "customer-service"
        or "technical." If you do not indicate a value, the default is "technical."

        .. note::

           Service limit increases are not supported by the Support API; you must submit service
           limit increase requests in `Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support>`__ .
           The ``caseId`` is not the ``displayId`` that appears in `Support Center
           <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support>`__ . You can use the  DescribeCases API to get
           the ``displayId`` .

        * **serviceCode.** The code for an AWS service. You can get the possible ``serviceCode``
        values by calling  DescribeServices .

        * **categoryCode.** The category for the service defined for the ``serviceCode`` value. You
        also get the category code for a service by calling  DescribeServices . Each AWS service
        defines its own set of category codes.

        * **severityCode.** A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines
        the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You can get
        the possible ``severityCode`` values by calling  DescribeSeverityLevels . For more
        information about the meaning of the codes, see  SeverityLevel and `Choosing a Severity
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#choosing-severity>`__
        .

        * **subject.** The **Subject** field on the AWS Support Center `Create Case
        <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.

        * **communicationBody.** The **Description** field on the AWS Support Center `Create Case
        <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.

        * **attachmentSetId.** The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using
        AddAttachmentsToSet .

        * **language.** The human language in which AWS Support handles the case. English and
        Japanese are currently supported.

        * **ccEmailAddresses.** The AWS Support Center **CC** field on the `Create Case
        <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page. You can list email
        addresses to be copied on any correspondence about the case. The account that opens the case
        is already identified by passing the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method
        or function call from one of the programming languages supported by an `AWS SDK
        <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__ .

          To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use
          AddCommunicationToCase .

        A successful  CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. Case numbers are used
        by the  DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases.
