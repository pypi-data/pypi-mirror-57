zfit has been developed with support from the University of ZÃ¼rich and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under contracts 168169 and 174182.

The idea of zfit is inspired by the `TensorFlowAnalysis <https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis>`_ framework developed by Anton Poluektov using the TensorFlow open source library.
