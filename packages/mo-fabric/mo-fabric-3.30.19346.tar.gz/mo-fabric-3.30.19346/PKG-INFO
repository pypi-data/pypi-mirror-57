Description: # mo-fabric
        
        A façade atop [fabric2](http://www.fabfile.org/)
        
        ## Overview
        
        I have revisited [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) (September 2018) to find it can handle multiple threads and multiple connections!  This is great news: it makes all my automation faster!
        
        Like with most APIs, I made a façade because Fabric is not congruent to my own programming conventions. This is not bad, just different: The domain I work in is slightly different than what the Fabric developers expect. 
        
        Here are the differences:
        
        * All `stdout` and `strerr` from the remote machine is annotated, and shunted, to the local logging module.
        * A few convenience methods are added:
          * `conn.exists(path)` - to test if a remote file exists
          * `with conn.warn_only():` - context manager if you do not care if your commands fail
          * `get(remote, local, use_sudo=False)` - allows you to use tilde (`~`) on Windows to refer to home directory
          * `put(local, remote, use_sudo=False)` - similar to `get`, except copies files to remote
          * `sudo(command)` works with the `cd()` context manager
          * `Result.__contains__()` so checking for patterns in command output is simpler:
            ```python
                result = conn.run("ls /data1", warn=True)
                not_found = "No` such file or directory" in result
            ```
