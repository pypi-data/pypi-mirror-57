# gemelli

Gemelli is a tool box for running tensor factorization on sparse compositional omics datasets. Gemelli performs unsupervised dimensionality reduction of spatiotemporal microbiome data. The outlut of gemelli helps to resolve spatiotemporal subject variation and the biological features that separate them. 

## Installation

To install the most up to date version of deicode, run the following command

    # pip (only supported for QIIME2 >= 2018.8)
    pip install gemelli

**Note**: that gemelli is not compatible with python 2, and is compatible with Python 3.4 or later. 

## Using gemelli  inside [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/)

A QIIME2 tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/cameronmartino/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/QIIME2-jansson-ibd-tutorial.md).

`Note: a more formal tutorial is coming soon.`

```bash
$ qiime gemelli ctf --help

Usage: qiime gemelli ctf [OPTIONS]

  Gemelli resolves spatiotemporal subject variation and the biological
  features that separate them. In this case, a subject may have several
  paired samples, where each sample may be a time point. The output is akin
  to conventional beta-diversity analyses but with the paired component
  integrated in the dimensionality reduction.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                         Input table in biom format.                [required]

                         Metadata column containing subject IDs to use for

                         individual ID at either state_1 to state_N, that
                         subject will be mean grouped by default.   [required]
  --p-state-column TEXT  Metadata column containing state (e.g.,Time,
                         BodySite) across which samples are paired. At least

                         willgive more accurate factorization but will be more
