N_PIXEL = 1440
#: The inner diameter of the hexagonal pixels in mm.
#: This is also the grid constant of the hex grid.
PIXEL_SPACING_MM = 9.5
FOCAL_LENGTH_MM = 4889
#:The segmented imaging reflector of FACT is well described using the thin lens
#:equation. However, the most prominent deviation from the thin lens, is the
#:imaging reflectors pincushin distortion. The pincushin distortion projects
#:incomning light further away from the optical axis as it is expected from the
#:thin lens equation. The additional outward pin-cushin distortion gets stronger
#:the further the distance to the optical axis is.
#:
#:``actual_projection_angle = (1 + PINCUSHION_DISTORTION_SLOPE) * thin_lens_prediction_angle``
#:
#:Example:
#:According to the tÄ¥in lens model one expects incoming light of 1.5 deg
#:incident angle relative to the optical axis to be projected in:
#:
#:``tan(1.5deg)*focal_length = 128.02mm``
#:
#:distance to the optical axis on the image sensor screen.
#:But the reflector actually projects this incoming light further to the
#:outside to:
#:
#:``128.02mm * (1 + PINCUSHION_DISTORTION_SLOPE) = 130.67mm``
#:
#:As one can see, the correction is minor. It is only half a pixel at the outer
#:rim of the field of view.
