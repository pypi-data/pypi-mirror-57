        ## Overview 
        
        This library has been developed in an effort to systematize quantitative analysis of stormwater control algorithms.
        It is a natural extension of the Open-Storm's mission to open up and ease access into the technical world of smart stormwater systems.
         Our initial efforts allowed us to develop open source and free tools for anyone to be able to deploy flood sensors, measure green infrastructure, or even control storm or sewer systems.
         Now we have developed a tool to be able to test the performance of algorithms used to coordinate these different sensing and control technologies that have been deployed throughout urban water systems.    
        
        For the motivation behind this effort, we refer the reader to our manuscript [*pystorms*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3313336). In general, this repo provides three components:
        
        1. A library of `scenarios` that are built to allow for systematic quantitative evaluation of stormwater control algorithms, 
        2. A stormwater hydraulic simulator named `pyswmm_lite` and forked heavily from OWA's [SWMM](https://github.com/kLabUM/Stormwater-Management-Model.git) and [pyswmm](https://github.com/kLabUM/pyswmm_lite.git), and
        3. An `environment` script that links the `pyswmm_lite` simulator to the `scenarios`, and can be edited/updated by users who might want to interface the `scenarios` with other stormwater simulator software (the `environment` script is included in `pyswmm-lite`).
        
        This is a alpha version of the library, eventually `pyswmm_lite` dependency would be deprecated in the favour of `pyswmm`
        
        ## Getting Started 
        
        ### Installation 
        
        **Requirements**
        
        - python 3+
        - numpy
        - pyswmm_lite
        
        ```bash 
        pip install pyswmm_lite
        pip install pystorms
        ```
        Please raise an issue on the repository or reach out if you run into any issues installing the package. 
        
        ### Example 
        
        Here is an example implementation on how you would use this library for evaluating the ability of a rule based control in maintaining the flows in a network below a desired threshold. 
        
        ```python 
        import pystorms 
        import numpy as np
        
        # Define your awesome controller 
        def controller(state):
        	actions = np.ones(len(state))
        	for i in range(0, len(state)):
        		if state[i] > 0.5:
        			actions[i] = 1.0
        	return actions 
        	
        
        env = pystorms.scenarios.theta() # Initialize scenario 
        
        done = False
        while not done:
        	state = env.state()
        	actions = controller(state)
        	done = env.step(actions)
        
        performance = env.performance()
        
        ```
