Contributions are welcome and i will do my best to merge PR quickly.

Here are some guidelines that makes everything easier for everybody:

1. Fork it.
1. Create a feature branch containing only your fix or feature.
1. Preferably add/update tests. Features or fixes that don't have good tests
   won't be accepted before someone adds them (mostly...).
1. Create a pull request.

### Setup

Install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Testing

This projects uses pytest, so to run all the tests use:

    pytest -v

At the moment functionality related to websocket v2 is not properly tested.

- Implement all API calls that Bitfinex make available (v1).
