            $ virtualenv --no-site-packages --python="python3" virtualenv
            $ source virtualenv/bin/activate

        After setting up the virtual environment, you can generate HTML documentation
        by running `./build_docs.sh` from the root of the project. The documentation will
        be placed in `./docs_out`.
