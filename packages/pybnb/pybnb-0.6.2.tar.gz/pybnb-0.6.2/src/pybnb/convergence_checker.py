    Parameters
    ----------
    sense : {:obj:`minimize <pybnb.common.minimize>`, :obj:`maximize <pybnb.common.maximize>`}
        The objective sense for the problem.
    absolute_gap : float, optional
        The absolute difference between the objective and
        bound that determines optimality. By default, this
        option also controls eligibility for the queue. See
        the "queue_tolerance" setting for more
        information. (default: 0)
    relative_gap : float, optional
        The relative difference between the objective and
        bound that determines optimality. (default: None)
    scale_function : function, optional
        A function with signature `f(bound, objective) ->
        float` that returns a positive scale factor used to
        convert the absolute difference between the bound
        and objective into a relative difference. The
        relative difference is compared with the
        `relative_gap` convergence tolerance to determine if
        the solver should terminate. The default is
        equivalent to `max{1.0,|objective|}`. Other examples
        one could use are `max{|bound|,|objective|}`,
        `(|bound|+|objective|)/2`, etc.
    queue_tolerance : float, optional
        The absolute tolerance used when deciding if a node
        is eligible to enter the queue. The difference
        between the node bound and the incumbent objective
        must be greater than this value. Leaving this
        argument at its default value indicates that this
        tolerance should be set equal to the "absolute_gap"
        setting. Setting this to zero means that nodes whose
        bound is equal to the incumbent objective are not
        eligible to enter the queue. Setting this to larger
        values can be used to limit the queue size, but it
        should be kept small enough to allow absolute and
        relative optimality tolerances to be met. This
        option can also be set to `None` to allow nodes with
        a bound equal to (but not greater than) the
        incumbent objective to enter the queue.
    branch_tolerance : float, optional
        The absolute tolerance used when deciding if the
        computed objective and bound for a node are
        sufficiently different to branch into the node. The
        default value of zero means that branching will
        occur if the bound is not exactly equal to the
        objective. This option can be set to `None` to
        enable branching for nodes with a bound and
        objective that are exactly equal. (default: 0)
    comparison_tolerance : float, optional
        The absolute tolerance used when deciding if two
        objective or bound values are sufficiently different
        to be considered improved or worsened. This
        tolerance controls when the solver considers a new
        incumbent objective to be found. It also controls
        when warnings are output about bounds becoming worse
        on child nodes. Setting this to larger values can be
        used to avoid the above solver actions due to
        insignificant numerical differences, but it is
        better to deal with these numerical issues by
        rounding numbers to a reliable precision before
        returning them from the problem methods.
        (default: 0)
    objective_stop : float, optional
        If provided, the "objective_limit" termination
        criteria is met when a feasible objective is found
        that is at least as good as the specified value. If
        this value is infinite, the termination criteria is
        met as soon as a finite objective is found.
        (default: None)
    bound_stop : float, optional
        If provided, the "objective_limit" termination
        criteria is met when the best bound on the objective
        is at least as good as the specified value. If this
        value is infinite, the termination criteria is met
        as soon as a finite objective is found.
