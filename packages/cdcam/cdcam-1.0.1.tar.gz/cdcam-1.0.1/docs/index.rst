The **Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** (``cdcam``) is a decision support
tool to quantify the performance of national digital infrastructure strategies for mobile
broadband, focussing on 4G and 5G technologies.

Statement of Need
-----------------

Every decade a new generation of cellular technology is standardised and released.
Increasingly, given the importance of the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and Smart Health
applications, both governments and other digital ecosystem actors want to understand the costs
associated with digital connectivity.

However, there are very few geospatial open-source tools to help simultaneously understand
both the engineering and cost implications of new connectivity technologies such as 5G. Hence,
``cdcam`` has been developed to address this key research need.

Applications
------------

``cdcam`` has already been used to test the capacity, coverage and cost of 5G infrastructure
in Britain [@Oughton:2018a; @Oughton:2018b] and the Netherlands [@Oughton:2019a].

The model is one of several infrastructure simulation models being used in ongoing research
as part of the ITRC Mistral project to analyse national infrastructure systems-of-systems,
using scenarios of population change generated by ``simim`` [@simim] and connected by a
simulation model coupling library, ``smif`` [@smif].

Setup and configuration
-----------------------

All code for ``cdcam`` is written in Python (Python>=3.5) and has a number of dependencies. See
``requirements.txt`` for a full list.

``cdcam`` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/cdcam/>`_. To install, run::

    pip install cdcam

Using a virtual environment
---------------------------

To set up a virtual environment follow the code below::

    python -m venv cdcam
    cdcam/bin/python cdcam/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    cdcam/bin/python cdcam/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    cdcam/bin/python cdcam/bin/pip install cdcam
    cdcam/bin/python cdcam/bin/pip install pytest pytest-cov
    pytest --cov-report=term --cov=cdcam tests/

Using conda
-----------

The recommended installation method is to use `conda
<http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_, which handles packages and virtual environments,
along with the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel which has a host of pre-built
libraries and packages.

Create a conda environment called `cdcam`::

    conda create --name cdcam python=3.7

Activate it (run this each time you switch projects)::

    conda activate cdcam

First, install optional packages::

    conda install fiona shapely rtree pyproj tqdm

Then install `cdcam`::

    pip install cdcam

Alternatively, for development purposes, clone this repository and run:

    python setup.py develop

Install test/dev requirements::

    conda install pytest pytest-cov

Run the tests::

    pytest --cov-report=term --cov=cdcam tests/

Background and funding
----------------------

The **Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** has been collaboratively developed
between the `Environmental Change Institute <http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/>`_ at the `University of
Oxford <https://www.ox.ac.uk/>`_, the `Networks and Operating Systems Group (NetOS)
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos>`_ at the `Cambridge Computer Laboratory
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk>`_,  and the UK's `Digital Catapult
<https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/>`_. Research activity between 2017-2018 also took place at
the `Cambridge Judge Business School <http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/>`_ at the `University of
Cambridge <http://www.cam.ac.uk/>`_.

Development has been funded by the EPSRC via (i) the `Infrastructure Transitions Research
Consortium <http://www.itrc.org.uk/>`_ (EP/N017064/1) and (ii) the UK's `Digital Catapult
<https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/>`_ Researcher in Residence programme.
