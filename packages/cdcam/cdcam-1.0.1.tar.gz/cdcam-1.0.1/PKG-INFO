        Description
        ===========
        
        The **Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** (`cdcam`) is a decision support tool
        to quantify the performance of national digital infrastructure strategies for mobile broadband,
        focussing on 4G and 5G technologies.

        Setup and configuration
        =======================
        
        All code for **The Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** is written in Python
        (Python>=3.5). The core model has no other dependencies.
        
        See `requirements-dev.txt` for a full list of optional dependencies used in supporting
        scripts.
        
        
        Using conda
        -----------
        
        The recommended installation method is to use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html),
        which handles packages and virtual environments, along with the
        [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/) channel which has a host of pre-built libraries and
        packages.
        
        Create a conda environment called `cdcam`:
        
            conda create --name cdcam python=3.7
        
        Activate it (run this each time you switch projects):
        
            conda activate cdcam
        
        First, install optional packages:
        
            conda install fiona shapely rtree pyproj tqdm
        
        Then install `cdcam`:
        
            pip install cdcam
        
        Alternatively, for development purposes, clone this repository and run:
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        Install test/dev requirements:
        
            conda install pytest pytest-cov
        
        Run the tests:
        
            pytest --cov-report=term --cov=cdcam tests/
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        If you want to quickly generate results, first download the sample dataset available at [DOI
        10.5281/zenodo.3525285](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3525285), then run:
        
            python scripts/run.py
        
        You should see the model printing output such as `Running: baseline baseline macrocell`
        which means the data have been loaded and you are running the baseline population scenario,
        baseline data throughput scenario and macrocell upgrade strategy.
        
        You should then see an output for each year (`- 2020`) indicating how much money was spent on
        either servicing a specified coverage obligation (`Service`) or in meeting demand (`Demand`):
        
            - 2020
            Service 0
            Demand 14614
            - 2021
            Service 0
            Demand 3293

        Started](https://cdcam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) documentation.

        Background and funding
        ======================
        
        The **Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** has been collaboratively developed
        between the [Environmental Change Institute](http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of
        Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), the [Networks and Operating Systems Group
        (NetOS)](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos) at the [Cambridge Computer
        Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk),  and the UK's [Digital
        Catapult](http://www.digtalcatapult.org.uk). Research activity between 2017-2018 also took
        place at the [Cambridge Judge Business School](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/) at the
        [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).
        
        Development has been funded by the EPSRC via (i) the [Infrastructure Transitions Research
        Consortium](http://www.itrc.org.uk/) (EP/N017064/1) and (ii) the UK's [Digital
        Catapult](http://www.digicatapult.org.uk) Researcher in Residence programme.
