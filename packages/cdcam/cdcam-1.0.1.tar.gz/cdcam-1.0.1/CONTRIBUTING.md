Contributing Guidelines
=======================

We welcome contributions to cdcam.

When submitting a change to the repository, please first create an issue that
covers the item that you'd like to change, update or enhance. Once a discussion
has yielded a vote of support for that addition to the package, you are ready
to submit a pull request.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

Create a branch for local development
-------------------------------------

Use the `git checkout` command to create your own branch, and pick a name
that describes the changes that you are making:

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

Test the package
----------------

Ensure that the tests pass, and the documentation builds successfully:

    pytest
    make docs

Commit and push your changes
----------------------------

Once you are sure that all tests are passing, you can commit your changes
and push to GitHub:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Submit a pull request on GitHub
-------------------------------

When submitting a pull request:

- All existing tests should pass. Please make sure that the test
  suite passes, both locally and on
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/nismod/cdcam)
  Status on
  Travis will be visible on a pull request. If you want to enable
  Travis CI on your own fork, please read the
  [getting started docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)

- New functionality should include tests. Please write reasonable
  tests for your code and make sure that they pass on your pull request.

- Classes, methods, functions, etc. should have docstrings. The first
  line of a docstring should be a standalone summary. Parameters and
  return values should be documented explicitly.

- The API documentation is automatically generated from docstrings, which should conform to
  NumpPy styling. For examples, see the [Napoleon
  docs](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html)

- Please note that tests are also run via Travis-CI on our documentation.
  So be sure that any `.rst` file submissions are properly formatted and
  tests are passing.


Documentation Updates
---------------------

Improving the documentation and testing for code already in `cdcam` is a great way to get
started if you'd like to make a contribution. Please note that our documentation files are in
[ReStructuredText
(.rst)](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format and
format your pull request accordingly.

To build the documentation, use the command:

    make docs

By default `make docs` will only rebuild the documentation if source files (e.g., `.py` or
`.rst` files) have changed. To force a rebuild, use `make -B docs`. You can preview the
generated documentation by opening `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.
