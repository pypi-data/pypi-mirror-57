        # pipshow
        
        A script to show details of any python package, irrespective of whether its installed or not.
        
        # Synopsis
        
        I came across the need today to show details about a random PyPi package which wasn't installed on my machine yet. So I simply did `pip show <package_name>` but it didn't return anything. `pip` has also removed the `--no-install` option for simulating an install through which I could have known these details too. So I wrote this little script to show the details of any package even if it isn't installed on your machine.
        
        # Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install pipshow
        ```
        
        # Usage
