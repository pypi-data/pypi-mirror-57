        Core modules for Abstrys Python applications
        ############################################
        
        This repository contains core modules used by a number of different applications:
        
        It consists of the following modules:
         
        * `abstrys/app_settings.py` â€“ stores application settings in a directory named after the application
          (`~/.dhop/settings.json`). It's basically just a dict that knows how to store and restore itself.
        
        Installing it
        =============
        
        If you've installed any of my other applications, this library is likely to be already installed.
        
        However, if you want to install it from source, just run the setup script:
        
            ./setup.py install --user
