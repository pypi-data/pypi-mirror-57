## How to use

### Type checking

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for `appmesh` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[mypy-boto3-appmesh]
```

Use `boto3` with `mypy_boto3` in your project and enjoy type checking.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3 import appmesh
# alternative import if you do not want to install mypy_boto3 package
# import mypy_boto3_appmesh as appmesh

# Use this client as usual, now mypy can check if your code is valid.
# Check if your IDE supports function overloads,
# you probably do not need explicit type annotations
# client = boto3.client("appmesh")
client: appmesh.AppMeshClient = boto3.client("appmesh")

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: appmesh.AppMeshClient = session.client("appmesh")


# Paginators need type annotation on creation
list_meshes_paginator: appmesh.ListMeshesPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_meshes")
list_routes_paginator: appmesh.ListRoutesPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_routes")
list_tags_for_resource_paginator: appmesh.ListTagsForResourcePaginator = client.get_paginator("list_tags_for_resource")
list_virtual_nodes_paginator: appmesh.ListVirtualNodesPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_virtual_nodes")
list_virtual_routers_paginator: appmesh.ListVirtualRoutersPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_virtual_routers")
list_virtual_services_paginator: appmesh.ListVirtualServicesPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_virtual_services")
```

## How it works

Fully automated [builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- Latest version of `boto3` is used.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from latest documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
