Description: # securedrop-log
        
        This is a Python module and qrexec service for logging in Qubes for [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org).
        
        ## How to use/try this?
        
        In our example, we will use a vm named *logging* for storing logs, and we will use 
        *workvm* to send in logs to the *logging* vm.
        
        ### In dom0
        
        - Create a file `/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/securedrop.Log` in `dom0` with the following content.
        
        ```
        workvm logging allow
        @anyvm @anyvm deny
        ```
        
        ### In logging vm
        
        Add the following content to `/etc/qubes-rpc/securedrop.Log`
        
        ```
        /usr/sbin/securedrop-log
        ```
        
        and then place `securedrop-log` script to `/usr/sbin/` directory and make sure that
        it is executable.
        
        ### To use from any Python code in workvm
        
        Here is an example code using Python logging
        
        ```Python
        import logging
        from securedrop_log import SecureDropLog
        
        def main():
            handler = SecureDropLog("workvm", "proxy-debian")
            logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, handlers=[handler])
            logger = logging.getLogger("example")
        
            logger.info("kushal says it works")
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        
        ```
        
        ## The journalctl example
        
        You will need `python3-systemd` package for the same.
        
        The code is in `journal-example.py` file.
