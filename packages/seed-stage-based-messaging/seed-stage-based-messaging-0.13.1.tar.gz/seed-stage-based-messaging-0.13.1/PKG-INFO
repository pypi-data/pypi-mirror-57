Description: ==========================
        Seed Stage-Based Messaging
        ==========================
        
        The Seed Stage-Based Messaging Store is one of the microservices in the Seed
        Stack.
        
        The Stage-Based Messaging Store has the following key responsibilities:
        
        - Store the stage-based content (both audio and text).
        - Store the stage-based content schedules.
        - Store the stage-based content subscriptions for each user.
        
        This uses the django cache framework to provide locking for the processing of
        subscriptions, so please ensure that the `REDIS_URL` setting is set.
