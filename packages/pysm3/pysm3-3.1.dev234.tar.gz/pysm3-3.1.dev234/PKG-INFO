        # PySM 3
        
        PySM generates full-sky simulations of Galactic emissions in intensity and polarization relevant to CMB experiments.
        It is a large refactor of [PySM 2](https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public) focused on reducing memory usage,
        improving performance and run in parallel with MPI.
