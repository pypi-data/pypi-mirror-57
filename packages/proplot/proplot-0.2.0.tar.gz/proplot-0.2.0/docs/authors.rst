`Luke Davis`_ is the sole developer as of November 2019. He is a graduate student in climate science at Colorado State University who has always been frustrated by repetitive and clumsy plotting code. As an undergraduate, he developed an extensive set of `MATLAB plotting utilities <https://github.com/lukelbd/matfuncs>`__ for personal use. When he switched to python in graduate school, he replicated most of these utilities in python, learned more about the language, began to rapidly develop them, and thought they were worth sharing with the rest of the scientific community. He has sunk countless hours into this project and hopes you find it useful. Luke is also a vim enthusiast and has authored `a number of vim plugins <https://github.com/lukelbd?tab=repositories>`__.

`Riley Brady`_ is an important contributor. He helped the authors organize and deploy this project, set up automatic testing, and allow new contributors to join. He is also the earliest user of ProPlot and helped fix a lot of the initial bugs. If your field is atmospheric science, check out his `decadal climate prediction package <https://github.com/bradyrx/climpred>`__.
