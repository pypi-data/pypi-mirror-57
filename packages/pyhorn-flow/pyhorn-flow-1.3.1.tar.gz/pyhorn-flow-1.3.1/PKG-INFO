Description: # PyHorn
        
        An unofficial Python client to interact with Bullhorn's REST API.
        We developed this client to facilitate the integration of FLOW's systems with Bullhorn, and decided to disclose the source for any other developers that may find it useful.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install pyhorn-flow`
        
        ## Authentication
        
        Authentication requires a simple JSON file containing the following auth-related data (provided by Bullhorn themselves):
        
        - username
        - password
        - client_id
        - client_secret
        
        Other fields are filled automatically and stored in `file_name` for better use of the authenticated session.
        
        ```json
        {
         "file_name": "auth.json",
         "client_id": "GUIDprovidedbybullhorn",
         "client_secret": "secretprovidedbybullhorn",
         "username": "apiuser",
         "password": "yourpasswordshouldgohere"
        }
        ```
        
        ## Supported Functions
