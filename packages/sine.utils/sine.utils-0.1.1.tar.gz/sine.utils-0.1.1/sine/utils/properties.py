'''
read/write .properties file in a simple line-oriented format.

Note: the code takes Java class `java.util.Properties` for reference.

properties data are key-value pairs stored in a dictionary.

common usage in file I/O:

properties = load(file)
store(file, properties)

main features:
* seperate key and value by one of `=`, `:`, ` `, `\\t`
* ignore whitespaces leading in a line or around `=` or `:`
* comment line begin with `#` or `!`
* escape unicode by `\\uxxxx`
* escape special characters by adding `\\`

others:
* data line ends with '\\' discard the line break

differences with Java:
* store method will not write datetime comment

    ---detail from Java document---
     * Properties are processed in terms of lines. There are two
     * kinds of line, natural lines and logical lines.
     * A natural line is defined as a line of
     * characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator
     * characters ('\\n' or '\\r' or '\\r\\n')
     * or by the end of the stream. A natural line may be either a blank line,
     * a comment line, or hold all or some of a key-element pair. A logical
     * line holds all the data of a key-element pair, which may be spread
     * out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping
     * the line terminator sequence with a backslash character
     * '\\'.  Note that a comment line cannot be extended
     * in this manner; every natural line that is a comment must have
     * its own comment indicator, as described below. Lines are read from
     * input until the end of the *iteration* is reached.
     * 
     * A natural line that contains only white space characters is
     * considered blank and is ignored.  A comment line has an ASCII
     * '#' or '!' as its first non-white
     * space character; comment lines are also ignored and do not
     * encode key-element information.  In addition to line
     * terminators, this format considers the characters space
     * (' '), tab
     * ('\\t'), and form feed
     * ('\\f') to be white
     * space.
     * 
     * If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the
     * backslash escaping the line terminator sequence, the line
     * terminator sequence, and any white space at the start of the
     * following line have no affect on the key or element values.
     * The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing
     * (when loading) will assume all the characters constituting
     * the key and element appear on a single natural line after
     * line continuation characters have been removed. Note that
     * it is not sufficient to only examine the character
     * preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line
     * terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of
     * contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.
     * Since the input is processed from left to right, a
     * non-zero even number of 2n contiguous backslashes
     * before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes n
     * backslashes after escape processing.
     * 
     * The key contains all of the characters in the line starting
     * with the first non-white space character and up to, but not
     * including, the first unescaped '=',
     * ':', or white space character other than a line
     * terminator. All of these key termination characters may be
     * included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash
     * character; for example,
     * 
     * \\:\\=
     * 
     * would be the two-character key ":=".  Line
     * terminator characters can be included using \\r and
     * \\n escape sequences. Any white space after the
     * key is skipped; if the first non-white space character after
     * the key is '=' or ':', then it is
     * ignored and any white space characters after it are also
     * skipped.  All remaining characters on the line become part of
     * the associated element string; if there are no remaining
     * characters, the element is the empty string
     * "".  Once the raw character sequences
     * constituting the key and element are identified, escape
     * processing is performed as described above.
     * 
     * As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key
     * "Truth" and the associated element value
     * "Beauty":
     * 
     * Truth = Beauty
     *  Truth:Beauty
     * Truth                    :Beauty
     * 
     * As another example, the following three lines specify a single
     * property:
     * 
     * fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
     *                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
     *                                  kiwi, mango
     *
     * The key is "fruits" and the associated element is:
     * "apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"
     * Note that a space appears before each '\\' so that a space
     * will appear after each comma in the final result; the '\\',
     * line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation line are
     * merely discarded and are not replaced by one or more other
     * characters.
     * 
     * As a third example, the line:
     * cheeses
     * 
     * specifies that the key is "cheeses" and the associated
     * element is the empty string "".
     * 
     * Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape
     * sequences similar to those used for character and string literals
     * (see sections 3.3 and 3.10.6 of
     * The Java™ Language Specification).
     *
     * The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode
     * escapes used for characters and strings are:
     *
     *  *   Octal escapes are not recognized.
     *
     *  *   The character sequence '\\b' does not
     *      represent a backspace character.
     *
     *  *   The method does not treat a backslash character,
     *      '\\', before a non-valid escape character as an
     *      error; the backslash is silently dropped.  For example, in a
     *      Java string the sequence "\\z" would cause a
     *      compile time error.  In contrast, this method silently drops
     *      the backslash.  Therefore, this method treats the two character
     *      sequence "\\b" as equivalent to the single
     *      character 'b'.
     *
     *  *   Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes;
     *      however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters
     *      preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote
     *      characters, respectively.
     *
     *  *   Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Unicode escape
     *      sequence.
