          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            The GetEntitlementsRequest contains results from the GetEntitlements operation.

            - **Entitlements** *(list) --*

              The set of entitlements found through the GetEntitlements operation. If the result
              contains an empty set of entitlements, NextToken might still be present and should be
              used.

              - *(dict) --*

                An entitlement represents capacity in a product owned by the customer. For example,
                a customer might own some number of users or seats in an SaaS application or some
                amount of data capacity in a multi-tenant database.

                - **ProductCode** *(string) --*

                  The product code for which the given entitlement applies. Product codes are
                  provided by AWS Marketplace when the product listing is created.

                - **Dimension** *(string) --*

                  The dimension for which the given entitlement applies. Dimensions represent
                  categories of capacity in a product and are specified when the product is listed
                  in AWS Marketplace.

                - **CustomerIdentifier** *(string) --*

                  The customer identifier is a handle to each unique customer in an application.
                  Customer identifiers are obtained through the ResolveCustomer operation in AWS
                  Marketplace Metering Service.

                - **Value** *(dict) --*

                  The EntitlementValue represents the amount of capacity that the customer is
                  entitled to for the product.

                  - **IntegerValue** *(integer) --*

                    The IntegerValue field will be populated with an integer value when the
                    entitlement is an integer type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.

                  - **DoubleValue** *(float) --*

                    The DoubleValue field will be populated with a double value when the entitlement
                    is a double type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.

                  - **BooleanValue** *(boolean) --*

                    The BooleanValue field will be populated with a boolean value when the
                    entitlement is a boolean type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.

                  - **StringValue** *(string) --*

                    The StringValue field will be populated with a string value when the entitlement
                    is a string type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.

                - **ExpirationDate** *(datetime) --*

                  The expiration date represents the minimum date through which this entitlement is
                  expected to remain valid. For contractual products listed on AWS Marketplace, the
                  expiration date is the date at which the customer will renew or cancel their
                  contract. Customers who are opting to renew their contract will still have
                  entitlements with an expiration date.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              For paginated results, use NextToken in subsequent calls to GetEntitlements. If the
              result contains an empty set of entitlements, NextToken might still be present and
              should be used.
