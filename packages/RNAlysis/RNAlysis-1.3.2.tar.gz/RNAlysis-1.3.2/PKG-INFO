        What is it?
        -----------
        
        RNAlysis is a python package providing modular analysis pipeline for RNA sequencing data from *C. elegans*.
        The package includes various filtering methods, data visualisation, clustering analyses, enrichment anslyses and
        exploratory analyses.
        
        RNAlysis allows you to perform filtering and analyses at any order you wish.
        It has the ability to save or load your progress at any given phase,
        Wand document the order of operations you performed in the saved file names.
        
        RNAlysis works with sequencing count matrices and differential expression output files in general, and integrates in particular with python's HTSeq-count and R's DESeq2.
