    Simulates the coalescent with recombination under the specified model
    parameters and returns the resulting :class:`tskit.TreeSequence`. Note that
    Ne is the effective diploid population size (so the effective number
    of genomes in the population is 2*Ne), but ``sample_size`` is the
    number of (monoploid) genomes sampled.

    :param int sample_size: The number of sampled monoploid genomes.  If not
        specified or None, this defaults to the sum of the subpopulation sample
        sizes. Either ``sample_size``, ``population_configurations`` or
        ``samples`` must be specified.
    :param float Ne: The effective (diploid) population size for the reference
        population. This defaults to 1 if not specified.
    :param float length: The length of the simulated region in bases.
        This parameter cannot be used along with ``recombination_map``.
        Defaults to 1 if not specified.
    :param float recombination_rate: The rate of recombination per base
        per generation. This parameter cannot be used along with
        ``recombination_map``. Defaults to 0 if not specified.
    :param recombination_map: The map
        describing the changing rates of recombination along the simulated
        chromosome. This parameter cannot be used along with the
        ``recombination_rate`` or ``length`` parameters, as these
        values are encoded within the map. Defaults to a uniform rate as
        described in the ``recombination_rate`` parameter if not specified.
    :type recombination_map: :class:`.RecombinationMap`
    :param float mutation_rate: The rate of infinite sites
        mutations per unit of sequence length per generation.
        If not specified, no mutations are generated. This option only
        allows for infinite sites mutations with a binary (i.e., 0/1)
        alphabet. For more control over the mutational process, please
        use the :func:`.mutate` function.
    :param list population_configurations: The list of
        :class:`.PopulationConfiguration` instances describing the
        sampling configuration, relative sizes and growth rates of
        the populations to be simulated. If this is not specified,
        a single population with a sample of size ``sample_size``
        is assumed.
    :type population_configurations: list or None.
    :param list migration_matrix: The matrix describing the rates
        of migration between all pairs of populations. If :math:`N`
        populations are defined in the ``population_configurations``
        parameter, then the migration matrix must be an
        :math:`N \\times N` matrix with 0 on the diagonal, consisting of
        :math:`N` lists of length :math:`N` or an :math:`N \\times N` numpy
        array, with the [j, k]th element giving the fraction of
        population j that consists of migrants from population k in each
        generation.
    :param list demographic_events: The list of demographic events to
        simulate. Demographic events describe changes to the populations
        in the past. Events should be supplied in non-decreasing
        order of time in the past. Events with the same time value will be
        applied sequentially in the order that they were supplied before the
        simulation algorithm continues with the next time step.
    :param list samples: The list specifying the location and time of
        all samples. This parameter may be used to specify historical
        samples, and cannot be used in conjunction with the ``sample_size``
        parameter. Each sample is a (``population``, ``time``) pair
        such that the sample in position ``j`` in the list of samples
        is drawn in the specified population at the specfied time. Time
        is measured in generations ago, as elsewhere.
    :param int random_seed: The random seed. If this is `None`, a
        random seed will be automatically generated. Valid random
        seeds must be between 1 and :math:`2^{32} - 1`.
    :param int num_replicates: The number of replicates of the specified
        parameters to simulate. If this is not specified or None,
        no replication is performed and a :class:`tskit.TreeSequence` object
        returned. If :obj:`num_replicates` is provided, the specified
        number of replicates is performed, and an iterator over the
        resulting :class:`tskit.TreeSequence` objects returned.
    :param tskit.TreeSequence from_ts: If specified, initialise the simulation
        from the root segments of this tree sequence and return the
        completed tree sequence. Please see :ref:`here
        <sec_api_simulate_from>` for details on the required properties
        of this tree sequence and its interactions with other parameters.
        (Default: None).
    :param float start_time: If specified, set the initial time that the
        simulation starts to this value. If not specified, the start
        time is zero if performing a simulation of a set of samples,
        or is the time of the oldest node if simulating from an
        existing tree sequence (see the ``from_ts`` parameter).
    :param float end_time: If specified, terminate the simulation at the
        specified time. In the returned tree sequence, all rootward paths from
        samples with time < end_time will end in a node with one child with
        time equal to end_time. Sample nodes with time >= end_time will
        also be present in the output tree sequence. If not specified or ``None``,
        run the simulation until all samples have an MRCA at all positions in
        the genome.
    :param bool record_full_arg: If True, record all intermediate nodes
        arising from common ancestor and recombination events in the output
        tree sequence. This will result in unary nodes (i.e., nodes in marginal
        trees that have only one child). Defaults to False.
    :param model: The simulation model to use.
        This can either be a string (e.g., ``"smc_prime"``) or an instance of
        a simulation model class (e.g, ``msprime.DiscreteTimeWrightFisher(100)``.
        Please see the :ref:`sec_api_simulation_models` section for more details
        on specifying simulations models.
    :type model: str or simulation model instance
    :return: The :class:`tskit.TreeSequence` object representing the results
        of the simulation if no replication is performed, or an
        iterator over the independent replicates simulated if the
        :obj:`num_replicates` parameter has been used.
    :rtype: :class:`tskit.TreeSequence` or an iterator over
        :class:`tskit.TreeSequence` replicates.
    :warning: If using replication, do not store the results of the
        iterator in a list! For performance reasons, the same
        underlying object may be used for every TreeSequence
        returned which will most likely lead to unexpected behaviour.

      lineages choose parents, migrant lineages choose parents from their new
      population in the same generation.
    - Demographic events. All events with `previous_generation < event_time <=
      current_generation` are carried out here.
    - Lineages draw parents. Each (monoploid) extant lineage draws a parent
      from their current population.
    - Diploid recombination. Each parent is diploid, so all child lineages
      recombine back-and-forth into the same two parental genome copies. These
      become two independent lineages in the next generation.
    - Historical sampling events. All historical samples with
      `previous_generation < sample_time <= current_generation` are inserted.

        This function will calculate the mean coalescence rates and proportions
        of uncoalesced lineages between the lineages of the sample
        configuration provided in `num_samples`, at each of the times ago
        listed by steps, in this demographic model. The coalescence rate at
        time t in the past is the average rate of coalescence of
        as-yet-uncoalesed lineages, computed as follows: let :math:`p(t)` be
        the probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples
        has not yet coalesced by time :math:`t`, let :math:`p(z,t)` be the
        probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples has
        not yet coalesced by time :math:`t` *and* are both in population
        :math:`z`, and let :math:`N(z,t)` be the diploid effective population
        size of population :math:`z` at time :math:`t`. Then the mean
        coalescence rate at time :math:`t` is :math:`r(t) = (\\sum_z p(z,t) /
        (2 * N(z,t)) / p(t)`.

        The computation is done by approximating population size trajectories
        with piecewise constant trajectories between each of the steps. For
        this to be accurate, the distance between the steps must be small
        enough so that (a) short epochs (e.g., bottlenecks) are not missed, and
        (b) populations do not change in size too much over that time, if they
        are growing or shrinking. This function optionally provides a simple
        check of this approximation by recomputing the coalescence rates on a

            can occur in models where populations grow exponentially but are unused
            before some time in the past, and lead to floating point error.
