- Derived from BGS checked Hourly means 1997 to July 2019 taken from  

ftp://ftp.nerc-murchison.ac.uk/geomag/Swarm/AUX_OBS/hour/

Robust 4 monthly means from HMV, after subtracting CM4 SQ preds and CHAOS-6-x9 ext model, with input from RC index RC_1997-2019_August_v3.dat.  See Olsen et al. (2014) for details. 

Note robust means are computed in 4 month bins, not 1 month bins.

Basic file 4 monthly robust means file: GR_OBS_RMM_MF_less_bias_V31_4month.10

This is with the estimated crustal bias removed, calculated by median residual from CHAOS for each component at each obs.

Associated diagonal covariance matrix.  As for previous version, listed in order B_r for all observations, then B_theta, then B_phi, derived from covariances from detrended residuals from CHAOS core field, are found in

GR_OBS_RMM_MF_COV_V31_4month.10

SV estimates from annual diffs of 4 monthly RMM. Last SV data with only a small number of observatories available is 2019.00.  These are found in:

GR_OBS_RMM_SV_V31_4month.10

With covariances computed in a similar way and provided in

GR_OBS_RMM_SV_COV_V31_4month.10

Same but without the magnetospheric field correction from CHAOS applied
