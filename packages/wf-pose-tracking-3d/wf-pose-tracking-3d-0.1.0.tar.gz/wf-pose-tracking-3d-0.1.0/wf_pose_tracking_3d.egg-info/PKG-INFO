Description: # wf-pose-tracking-3d
        
        Classes and methods for performing 3D pose tracking from 2D poses:
        
        * Functions which load 2D pose data from Wildflower S3 directories
        
        * Functions which perform very basic 3D pose reconstruction from multi-camera 2D pose data
        
        * Functions which support basic visualization of 2D and 3D pose data
        
        ## Testing
        
        To run tests, change working directory to `/tests` and run one of the following.
        
        `python 3d_reconstruction_example.py` pulls a single frame of 2D pose data from S3 and performs a simple 3D pose reconstruction
        
        `python 3d_pose_tracking_example.py` pulls multiple frames of 2D pose data from a local file and builds a set of 3D pose tracks
        
        These scripts pull camera calibration parameter files and sample 2D pose data from `tests/data`
        
        To run these scripts (and to use any of the functions data from S3), you need to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to keys belonging to an account that is a member of the Wildflower `cameras` group.
