# %% CURRENT LINE
# Describes the magnetic field of a line current. The line is given by a set of
#   data points and the field is the superopsition of the fields of all linear
#   segments.

# i0   : float       [A]       current lowing from the first point to the last point
# pos  : arr3 float  [mm]      Position of observer
# possis: list or arr of arr3floats [mm]    Positions that define the line
