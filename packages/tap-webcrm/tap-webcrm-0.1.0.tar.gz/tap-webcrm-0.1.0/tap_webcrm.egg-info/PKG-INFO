Description: # tap-webcrm
        
        # installation
        
        install via `pip` using the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install tap-webcrm
        ```
        
        below is an example of a valid `config.json` for this tap.
        
        # Note
        
        ### singer.io compliance
        
        The tap supports `--discover` and `--catalog` as of release v0.1. To simplify your life when working with this, use the pip package `singer-discover`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install https://github.com/chrisgoddard/singer-discover/archive/master.zip
        ```
        
        ### Tables supported
        
        As of right now, Dreamdata only has use for the `Opportunity`, `Organisation` and `Person` tables - but it would be trivial to add support for other ones and PRs are welcome.
        
        # config
        
        the API_TOKEN can be provided as the environment variables `WEBCRM_API_TOKEN` or directly in the configuration as seen below:
        
        ```json
        {
          "api_token": "<API_TOKEN>"
        }
        ```
