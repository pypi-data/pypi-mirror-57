        ## How to use
        
        This package by itself is not very useful, it just gives you access to all
        underlying `boto3` services type annotations.
        
        It is the biggest package, so if you want to save 4 MB of space, install
        service packages directly, e.g. `pip install mypy-boto3-s3 mypy-boto3-ec2`
        
        ### Type checking
        
        Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.
        
        Install `boto3-stubs` for services that you use to get type checking working.
        
        ```bash
        # You can find a full list of modules below
        python -m pip install boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]
        ```
        
        Use `boto3` with `mypy_boto3` in your project and enjoy type checking.
        
        ```python
        import boto3
        
        from mypy_boto3 import s3
        # alternative import if you do not want to install mypy_boto3 package
        # import mypy_boto3_s3 as s3
        
        # Check if your IDE supports function overloads,
        # you probably do not need explicit type annotations
        # client = boto3.client("s3")
        client: s3.EC2Client = boto3.client("s3")
        
        # Oh, it must be `Bucket`... Thanks, mypy!
        client.create_bucket(bucket="bucket")
        ```
        
        ### Code auto-complete
        
        Not a single Python IDE supports `Literal` type overloads yet (but in `VSCode` support is just around the corner).
        Meanwhile, to have a nice auto-complete you can explicitly set types to help your IDE to get methods, arguments etc.
        
        ```python
        import boto3_name
        
        from mypy_boto3 import ec2
        
        # this is the only place where you have to set types explicitly
        client: ec2.EC2Client = boto3.client("ec2")
        resource: ec2.EC2ServiceResource = boto3.resource("ec2")
        
        # now you have auto-complete for methods, arguments and even return types
        ```
        
        ### Build services index
        
        This packages provides a CLI to build services index for `boto3-stubs`.
        
        ```bash
        # Use this command when you add or remove service packages
        python -m mypy_boto3
        ```
        
        ## How it works
        
        Fully automated [builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3) carefully generates
        type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
        a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:
        
        - Latest version of `boto3` is used.
        - Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
          extracted from latest documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
        - Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
        - Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
