-----------------


**PyEDDL** is a Python wrapper for [EDDL](https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl), the European Distributed Deep Learning library.

Each PyEDDL version requires a specific EDDL version:

PyEDDL version | EDDL version |
-------------- | ------------ |
0.1.0          | 0.2.2        |


## Quick start

The following assumes you have EDDL already installed in "standard"
system paths (e.g., `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/lib`).

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/deephealthproject/pyeddl.git
    cd pyeddl
    python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest
    python3 setup.py install

See [full installation instructions below](#installation).


## Getting started

```python
import pyeddl._core.eddl as eddl
import pyeddl._core.eddlT as eddlT

def main():
    eddl.download_mnist()

    epochs = 10
    batch_size = 100
    num_classes = 10

    in_ = eddl.Input([784])
    layer = in_
    layer = eddl.ReLu(eddl.Dense(layer, 1024))
    layer = eddl.ReLu(eddl.Dense(layer, 1024))
    layer = eddl.ReLu(eddl.Dense(layer, 1024))
    out = eddl.Activation(eddl.Dense(layer, num_classes), "softmax")
    net = eddl.Model([in_], [out])

    eddl.build(
        net,
        eddl.sgd(0.01, 0.9),
        ["soft_cross_entropy"],
        ["categorical_accuracy"],
        eddl.CS_CPU()
    )
    eddl.summary(net)

    x_train = eddlT.load("trX.bin")
    y_train = eddlT.load("trY.bin")
    x_test = eddlT.load("tsX.bin")
    y_test = eddlT.load("tsY.bin")
    eddlT.div_(x_train, 255.0)
    eddlT.div_(x_test, 255.0)

    eddl.fit(net, [x_train], [y_train], batch_size, epochs)
    eddl.evaluate(net, [x_test], [y_test])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can find more examples under `examples`.


## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3
- EDDL
- NumPy
- pybind11
- pytest (if you want to run the tests)


### EDDL Installation

Complete EDDL installation instructions are available at
https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl. Make sure you build EDDL with
shared library support. Here is a sample build sequence:

```
cd third_party/eddl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D EDDL_SHARED=ON ..
make
make install
```


### Enabling GPU acceleration

If EDDL was compiled for GPU, you need to export the `EDDL_WITH_CUDA`
environment variable **before installing PyEDDL** so that `setup.py` will also
link the `cudart`, `cublas` and `curand` libraries. These will be
expected in "standard" system locations, so you might need to create symlinks
depending on your CUDA toolkit installation. For instance:

```
export EDDL_WITH_CUDA="true"
ln -s /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcudart.so /usr/lib/
ln -s /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcurand.so /usr/lib/
ln -s /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/libcublas.so /usr/lib/
```

### PyEDDL installation

Install PyEDDL as follows:

```
python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest
python3 setup.py install
```

Then, you can test your installation by running the PyEDDL tests:

    pytest tests


### EDDL installed in an arbitrary directory

The above installation instructions assume EDDL has been installed in standard
system paths. However, EDDL supports installation in an arbitrary directory,
for instance:

```
cd third_party/eddl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D EDDL_SHARED=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/myuser/eddl ..
make
make install
```

You can tell the PyEDDL setup script about this via the EDDL_DIR environment
variable:

```
export EDDL_DIR=/home/myuser/eddl
python3 setup.py install
```

In this way, `setup.py` will look for additional include files in
`/home/myuser/eddl/include` and for additional libraries in
`/home/myuser/eddl/lib`.


### Advanced: enabling `newloss`

The `pyeddl._core.eddl.newloss` bindings require EDDL to be patched with the
`eddl.diff` file. If you wish to enable them, proceed as follows:

```
cd third_party/eddl
git apply ../../eddl.diff
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D EDDL_SHARED=ON ..
make
make install
```

Then uncomment the lines containing the bindings for `newloss` in
`src/eddl_addons.hpp` and rebuild pyeddl.
