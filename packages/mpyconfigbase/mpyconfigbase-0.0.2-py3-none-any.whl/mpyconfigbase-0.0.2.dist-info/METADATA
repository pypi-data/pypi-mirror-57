# MPyConfigBase

Configure automatic startup of MicroPython WLAN / AP / WebRepl during boot 

## General information

Use this together with [mpycntrl](https://pypi.org/project/mpycntrl/) for automation of the setup/deployment and configuration of MicroPython base interfaces. see also [mpycntrl on github](https://github.com/kr-g/mpycntrl)

## Best practice

* send cntrl+c
* upload the module file along with the configuration files directly (the config files are `wlan.cfg`, `softap.cfg` and `webrepl_cfg.py`)
* send reset

## Installation during deployment

The python class code can be retrieved by calling:

    fnam, src = MPyConfigBase.get_class_source() # get the module code
    cfgbootcode = MPyConfigBase.get_boot_install_code() # get the minimal autconfig code


## Sample Code

Some sample code for automatic deployment and configuration. In case of timeouts (error message: could not enter raw-repl) consider to use `with mpyc.timeout(1) as tout:` code block. 

This code is also available [here on github](https://github.com/kr-g/mpyconfigbase)

Reset the board during the deployment is here required since MicroPython needs to bring in the new code before the configuration can take place. If you follow the best practice given above this dont needs to be done.
