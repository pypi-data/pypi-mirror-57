Description: =============================================================================
        devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching
        =============================================================================
        
        
        PyPI cache
        ==========
        
        You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
        index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.
        
        
        User specific indexes
        =====================
        
        Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can have
        multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or
        ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through
        `devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.
        
        
        Index inheritance
        =================
        
        Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
        both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
        index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
        release candidate before you push it to PyPI.
        
        
        Good defaults and easy deployment
        =================================
        
        Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
        including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.
        
        
        Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
        ==============================================
        
        The complementary `devpi-client`_ tool
        helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
        installation workflows.
        
        See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation.

        5.3.0 (2019-12-03)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - fix #732: add ``--unix-socket-perms`` option to set Unix socket permissions when a Unix socket is in use, defaults to '600' if not specified, ignored if ``--unix-socket`` is not used.
        
        - proxy requests from the replica to the master will use number of seconds from the new ``--proxy-timeout`` option as their timeout value.
        
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - ignore obsolete pypi_whitelist index setting when sent by devpi-client and remove it when an index config is updated.
        
        
        5.2.0 (2019-10-18)
        ==================
        
        Deprecations and Removals
        -------------------------
        
        - The ``--export`` option is deprecated, use the new ``devpi-export`` command instead.
        
        - The ``--gen-config`` option is deprecated, use the new ``devpi-gen-config`` command instead.
        
        - The ``--import`` option is deprecated, use the new ``devpi-import`` command instead.
        
        - The ``--init`` option is deprecated, use the new ``devpi-init`` command instead.
        
        - The ``--passwd`` option is deprecated, use the new ``devpi-passwd`` command instead.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - fix #253: add ``--unix-socket`` option to listen on a unix socket. When this is used the ``--host`` and ``--port`` options are forbidden.
        
        - Add new option ``mirror_use_external_urls`` for mirrors which when ``true`` redirects to the original release URL when the release isn't locally cached yet. No new releases are stored locally from that point on. The metadata is still stored in the database.
        
        - Add devpi-fsck command which compares the hash of files with the hash in the database.
        
        - Metrics for the sqlite storage cache are exposed in the JSON output of the +status view.
        
        - Storage options can now be specified as a dict in yaml config files.
        
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - fix #403: extract auth credentials from ``--master-url`` to prevent them from leaking in logs and ``+status``.
        
        - fix #545: provide proper error message when there is an exception during push to an external repository.
        
        - fix #686: prevent name clashes for toxresults by including the timestamp in the filename.
        
        - fix #722: prevent bogus "failed to check mirror whitelist" warnings.
        
        - Fix possible race condition when writing files.
        
        - Fix possible assertion error if importing multiple changes in a replica fails in the middle and fetching a single change set is tried as fallback.
        
        - For plugins the ``offline`` attribute of mirror stage instances now works independently of the ``--offline-mode`` command line option. This only applies to ``_perstage`` methods.
        
        - Files created in a transaction are written directly to temporary files instead of being kept in memory until commit.
        
        - Unnecessary database writes where the final value didn't change are now prevented.
        
        
        Other Changes
        -------------
        
        - The timeout when fetching the list of remote projects for a mirror index is set to a minimum of 30s by default and to 60s when running as replica. Other fetches of mirrors still use the timeout specified via ``--request-timeout``.
        
        
        5.1.0 (2019-08-05)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Allow stage customizer plugins to filter projects and versions.
        
        - Replicas will use the multiple changelog endpoint added in devpi-server 4.9.0 to reduce the number of requests necessary to synchronize state.
        
        
        5.0.0 (2019-06-28)
        ==================
        
        Deprecations and Removals
        -------------------------
        
        - fix #518: There are no URLs on PyPI anymore that need to be scraped or crawled, so the code for that was removed.
        
        - removed support for long deprecated ``acl_upload`` and ``bases`` mirror index option. They were only kept for compatibility with devpi-client <= 2.4.1.
        
        - the ``--start``, ``--stop``, ``--status`` and ``--log`` options are deprecated. Use ``--gen-config`` to create example configuration files for various process managers.
        
        - removed long deprecated ``pypi_whitelist`` index option. It was only kept for compatibility with devpi-client <= 2.4.1.
        
        - deprecated Python 2.7 support. This is the last major version supporting Python 2.7. For upgrading to Python 3.x you have to export your data using your current setup with Python 2.7 and import it in a new installation with Python 3.x.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - fix #249: unknown keys for index configuration now result in an error instead of being silently ignored.
        
        - fix #625: project registration is now optional. A file upload with twine or setuptools will automatically register the project.
        
        - fix #636: support ignore_bases argument for project listings.
        
        - support ``:AUTHENTICATED:`` for permissions. This resolves to any user which is logged in, regardless of username or groups.
        
        - added experimental support for stage customizers to let plugins add index types with customized behaviour. See ``BaseStageCustomizer`` in ``model.py`` for the API and ``devpiserver_get_stage_customizer_classes`` for the registration.
        
        - support no_projects argument for index json requests. The list of projects will not be added to the result.
        
        - when credentials for the user are rejected, the error message now says so instead of claiming the user could not be found.
        
        
        Other Changes
        -------------
        
        - boolean values can now only be set via the following values: 'false', 'no', 'true', 'yes' and actual booleans in the REST API. Before any string not matching 'false' and 'no' was converted into boolean true.
        
        - the default logging configuration now outputs to stdout instead of stderr.
        
        - major releases don't require an export/import cycle anymore except when explicitly announced. You should always make a backup though! When upgrading to devpi-server 5.0.0 you can keep the state as is and even downgrade to the last 4.9.x release if necessary. Don't forget to backup before upgrades!
        
        - the server secret isn't automatically persisted for new installations. A server restart invalidates login tokens. An existing installation will still use it's stored secret, but log a warning. Use ``--secretfile`` to explicitly specify a persistent secret file.
        
        - the ``--storage`` option is now required when a storage plugin like devpi-postgresql is in use. It's recommended to use a configuration file for devpi-server to have everything in one place (see ``--configfile``).
        
        - for the ``--logger-cfg`` yaml loading we now use ``safe_load`` of ``ruamel.yaml`` instead of ``load`` from ``pyyaml``.
        
        
        4.9.0 (2019-04-26)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - implement #93: When creating a user, the password hash can be set directly with ``pwhash``. Upon database initialization allow setting root user password with ``--root-passwd`` and the password hash with ``--root-passwd-hash`` options. Thanks to Andreas Palsson.
        
        - decouple devpi server version from database version to enable major releases that do not require export import of data
        
        - support ``--hard-links`` option during import for releases and doc zips.
        
        - added new endpoint to download multiple changelog entries at once. This will be used for faster replication in the future.
        
        - add option ``--replica-file-search-path`` to point to existing files. If a match is found it will be copied locally instead of fetched from the master. These files could be from a previous replication attempt or separately copied/restored.
        
        - add ``--hard-links`` support for replicas together with the ``--replica-file-search-path`` option. When a matching file is found it's hard linked instead of writing a copy.
        
        
        Bug Fixes
        ---------
        
        - fix multiple triggering of mirror project names initialization.
        
        - fix updating time stamp of mirror project name cache when no project names have changed. This makes subsequent fetches actually use the cache instead of always fetching the data again from the mirror.
        
        - use timeout when waiting for data from master in replica on mirror simple pages.
        
        
        Other Changes
        -------------
        
        - slightly improved replica performance by removing unnecessary DB read and using fewer transactions.
