Description: pmg - Piptv M3U Generator
        =======
        
        An M3U generator for IPTV services [kodi/plex/etc.] using the same scraping logic as [piptv](https://github.com/schwifty42069/piptv)! *I provide this script and all support for it free of charge, but any donations are welcome and appreciated. They can be sent to this bitcoin address: **bc1qahz93vyljhjj0fsadu2m8zdhaqdaf60gnc7y2y** Thank you and enjoy!*
        
        **Installation**
        
        pmg is available on pypi. To install the script, do the following in a terminal/cmd prompt
        
        **Windows**
        
        ```
        pip install piptv_pmg
        ```
        
        **Ubuntu/Debian**
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install piptv_pmg
        ```
        
        *It is recommended to install the script using the above method (through pypi with pip). Doing it this way should take care of
        setting up a temporary environment with geckodriver for you! Feel free to give the repo a star if you enjoy it, though!*
        
        **Usage**
        
        To use the script to generate an M3U, simply run the script and pass the directory 
        (including file name) you would like the M3U to be written to with the -o flag. For example
        
        **Windows**
        
        ```
        python -m piptv_pmg.pmg -o "C:\Users\Example_Person\Example_dir\example.m3u"
        ```
        
        **Ubuntu/Debian**
        
        ```
        python3 -m piptv_pmg.pmg -o /home/some_user/some_dir/example.m3u
        ```
        
        **Plex setup**
        
        Detailed documentation for configuring plex to use this script can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/piptv-plex/home)
        
        
        *Documentation for cross platform automation of the script, as well as some processes for use with 
        specific IPTV services such a plex and kodi will be added shortly, we are still working on making
        them as clear and detailed as possible!*
