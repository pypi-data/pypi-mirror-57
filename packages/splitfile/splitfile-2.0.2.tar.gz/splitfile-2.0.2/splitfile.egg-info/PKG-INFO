Description: # splitfile
        
        Python file-like object that facilitates reading and writing of binary data split across multiple volumes (files) of a specified size.  Supports random access IO.
        
        Can be used with modules such as tarfile, zipfile, lzma, etc. enabling read/write of split archives.
        
        Note: Version 2.0 removes previously integrated encryption and compression options.  The
        breadth of choice across both suggests they are better handled as a separate layer,
        leaving splitfile to simply manage the final IO across volumes.
        
        ### Examples
        ```
        import splitfile
        
        with splitfile.open('data.bin', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(b'Hello, World!')
        ```
        ```
        import splitfile
        import tarfile
        
        with splitfile.open('data.bin', 'wb', volume_size=1000000) as f:
            with tarfile.open(mode='w', fileobj=f) as t:
                for file in files:
                    t.add(file)
             
        Result:
        data.bin
        data.bin.2
        data.bin.3
        ...
        ```
        ### Documentation
        
        splitfile.**open**(*filename, mode, volume_size=0, append_to_partial=True*)
        
        Returns a SplitFile object.
        
         - *filename* contains a valid file path.  Volumes add a suffix (.2, .3, etc.).
         - Supported *mode* values are `wb, wb+, ab, ab+, rb, rb+`.
         - *volume_size* specifies the max size of a volume in bytes.
         - *append_to_partial* set to True appends data written to the end of a previously created file by adding to the last volume if its size is less than *volume_size*.  If False, a new volume is always created for writing beyond the end of an existing file.
        
        ### Dependencies
