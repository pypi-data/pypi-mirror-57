          can't be used in conjunction with the ``DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`` parameter. This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

        :type DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier: string
        :param DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier:

          A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This parameter can't be used in
          conjunction with the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` parameter. This value is stored as a
          lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBClusterSnapshot.

          * If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the ``SnapshotType`` parameter must
          also be specified.

        :type SnapshotType: string
        :param SnapshotType:

          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following
          values:

          * ``automated`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been automatically taken by
          Amazon RDS for my AWS account.

          * ``manual`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been taken by my AWS account.

          * ``shared`` - Return all manual DB cluster snapshots that have been shared to my AWS
          account.

          * ``public`` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked as public.

          If you don't specify a ``SnapshotType`` value, then both automated and manual DB cluster
          snapshots are returned. You can include shared DB cluster snapshots with these results by
          enabling the ``IncludeShared`` parameter. You can include public DB cluster snapshots with
          these results by enabling the ``IncludePublic`` parameter.

          The ``IncludeShared`` and ``IncludePublic`` parameters don't apply for ``SnapshotType``
          values of ``manual`` or ``automated`` . The ``IncludePublic`` parameter doesn't apply when
          ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``shared`` . The ``IncludeShared`` parameter doesn't apply when
          ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``public`` .

        :type Filters: list
        :param Filters:

          A filter that specifies one or more DB cluster snapshots to describe.

          Supported filters:

          * ``db-cluster-id`` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names
          (ARNs).

          * ``db-cluster-snapshot-id`` - Accepts DB cluster snapshot identifiers.

          * ``snapshot-type`` - Accepts types of DB cluster snapshots.

          * ``engine`` - Accepts names of database engines.

          - *(dict) --*

            A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from
            a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific
            criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with
            the describe operation.

            .. note::

              Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

            The following actions can be filtered:

        :type MaxRecords: integer
        :param MaxRecords:

          The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the
          specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the
          response so you can retrieve the remaining results.

          Default: 100

          Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

        :type Marker: string
        :param Marker:

          An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribeDBClusterSnapshots``
          request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the
          marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords`` .

        :type IncludeShared: boolean
        :param IncludeShared:

          A value that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other
          AWS accounts that this AWS account has been given permission to copy or restore. By
          default, these snapshots are not included.

          You can give an AWS account permission to restore a manual DB cluster snapshot from
          another AWS account by the ``ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute`` API action.

        :type IncludePublic: boolean
        :param IncludePublic:

          A value that indicates whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and
          can be copied or restored by any AWS account. By default, the public snapshots are not
          included.

          You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public by using the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

        :type WaiterConfig: dict
        :param WaiterConfig:

          A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

        :type DBInstanceIdentifier: string
        :param DBInstanceIdentifier:

          The ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for. This parameter can't
          be used in conjunction with ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` . This parameter isn't
          case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

        :type DBSnapshotIdentifier: string
        :param DBSnapshotIdentifier:

          A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This parameter can't be used in conjunction
          with ``DBInstanceIdentifier`` . This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.

          * If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the ``SnapshotType`` parameter must
          also be specified.

        :type SnapshotType: string
        :param SnapshotType:

          The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

          * ``automated`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS
          for my AWS account.

          * ``manual`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my AWS account.

          * ``shared`` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my AWS account.

          * ``public`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.

          * ``awsbackup`` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the AWS Backup service. For
          information about AWS Backup, see the ` *AWS Backup Developer Guide.*
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html`__   The
          ``awsbackup`` type does not apply to Aurora.

          If you don't specify a ``SnapshotType`` value, then both automated and manual snapshots
          are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by
          default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the
          ``IncludeShared`` parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by
          enabling the ``IncludePublic`` parameter.

          The ``IncludeShared`` and ``IncludePublic`` parameters don't apply for ``SnapshotType``
          values of ``manual`` or ``automated`` . The ``IncludePublic`` parameter doesn't apply when
          ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``shared`` . The ``IncludeShared`` parameter doesn't apply when
          ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``public`` .

        :type Filters: list
        :param Filters:

          A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.

          Supported filters:

          * ``db-instance-id`` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs).

          * ``db-snapshot-id`` - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.

          * ``dbi-resource-id`` - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.

          * ``snapshot-type`` - Accepts types of DB snapshots.

          * ``engine`` - Accepts names of database engines.

          - *(dict) --*

            A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from
            a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific
            criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with
            the describe operation.

            .. note::

              Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

            The following actions can be filtered:

            * ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks``

            * ``DescribeDBClusterEndpoints``

            * ``DescribeDBClusters``

            * ``DescribeDBInstances``

            * ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions``

            - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              - *(string) --*

        :type MaxRecords: integer
        :param MaxRecords:

          The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the
          specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the
          response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.

          Default: 100

          Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

        :type Marker: string
        :param Marker:

          An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribeDBSnapshots`` request. If
          this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to
          the value specified by ``MaxRecords`` .

        :type IncludeShared: boolean
        :param IncludeShared:

          A value that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other
          AWS accounts that this AWS account has been given permission to copy or restore. By
          default, these snapshots are not included.
