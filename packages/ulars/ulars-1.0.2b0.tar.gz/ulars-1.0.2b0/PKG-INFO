        ## Installation
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        $ pip install setup.py
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.
        
        ### Environment Setup
        
        The following demonstrates setting up and working with a development environment:
        
        ```
        ### create a virtualenv for development
        
        $ make virtualenv
        
        $ source env/bin/activate
        
        
        ### run lars cli application
        
        $ lars --help
        
        
        ### run pytest / coverage
        
        $ make test
        ```
        
        
        ### Releasing to PyPi
        
        Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials:
        
        **~/.pypirc**:
        
        ```
        [pypi]
        username = YOUR_USERNAME
        password = YOUR_PASSWORD
        ```
        
        Then use the included helper function via the `Makefile`:
        
        ```
        $ make dist
        
        $ make dist-upload
        ```
        
        ## Deployments
        
        ### Docker
        
        Included is a basic `Dockerfile` for building and distributing `Lars`,
        and can be built with the included `make` helper:
        
        ```
        $ make docker
        
        $ docker run -it lars --help
        ```
