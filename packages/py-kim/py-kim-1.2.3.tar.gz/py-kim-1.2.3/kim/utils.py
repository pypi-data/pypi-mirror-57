    Just a brief word on the odd re-assignment of built in functions to kwargs.
    Given the huge number of times this function is called in the benchmarking suite,
    Python having to call the builtins from the global scope is actually fairly slow.

    By assigning them to kwargs they will be compiled in the module's scope and will
    be found using the LOAD_FAST lookup.  You can read more about this technique here
    http://jamesls.com/micro-optimizations-in-python-code-speeding-up-lookups.html

    This technique yielded between 3-5% performance increase so we felt it was worth the
    trade of with it being pretty weird.
