    """Represents an archival record.

    An `ArchiveRecord` uses a Typed version of `collections.namedtuple()`. The
    record is immutable.

    Example
    -------

    An archive record (`filepath`, `content`, `queued_time`) contains:

    - a `filepath` to the record
    - the `content` for archival
    - the `queued time` length of time waiting in the queue for archiving

class BookstoreContentsArchiver(FileContentsManager):
    """Manages archival of notebooks to storage (S3) when notebook save occurs.

    This class is a custom Jupyter
    `FileContentsManager <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/contents.html#contents-api>`_
    which holds information on storage location, path to it, and file to be
    written.

    Example
    -------

    - Bookstore settings combine with the parent Jupyter application settings.
    - A session is created for the current event loop.
    - To write to a particular path on S3, acquire a lock.
    - After acquiring the lock, `archive` method authenticates using the storage
      service's credentials.
    - If allowed, the notebook is queued to be written to storage (i.e. S3).

    path_locks : dict
        Dictionary of paths to storage and the lock associated with a path.
