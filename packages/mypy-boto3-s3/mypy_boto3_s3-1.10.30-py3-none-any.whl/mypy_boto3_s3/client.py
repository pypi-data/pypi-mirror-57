        This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional
        parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded
        parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part
        uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given
        multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all
        parts.

        To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage,
        you should call the  ListParts operation and ensure the parts list is empty.

        Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

        You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the  UploadPart
        operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
        operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all
        the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete
        Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure the parts list is
        complete, this operation concatenates the parts you provide in the list. For each part in
        the list, you must provide the part number and the ``ETag`` value, returned after that part
        was uploaded.

        Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete.
        After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that
        specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends
        whitespace characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail
        after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response
        body to determine whether the request succeeded.

        Note that if ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` fails, applications should be prepared to retry the
        failed requests. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Error Best Practices
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html>`__ .

          copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy
          API. For conceptual information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__ .

        When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata.
        However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To
        override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
        information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ .

        .. warning::

          Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a
          cross-region copy using a Transfer Acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request``
          error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__ .

        All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the
        source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST
        Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__
        . Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy
        the object to must be enabled for your account.

        To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether
        the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` ,
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , or ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` .

        .. note::

          All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed.

        You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored
        in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see `Storage Classes
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ .

        The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object
        is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS-managed encryption
        keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request
        that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS-managed encryption keys or
        by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side
        encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not
        encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side
        Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

        A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while
        Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you
        receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error
        response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can
        contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the
        response and handle it appropriately.

        If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

        .. note::

          If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it
          would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

        Consider the following when using request headers:

        * Consideration 1 – If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and
        x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:

          * x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true

          * x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false

        * Consideration 2 – If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and
        x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code:

          * x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false

          * x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true

        The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the
        destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 Pricing
        <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__ .

        Following are other considerations when using ``CopyObject`` :

          Versioning

        By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If
        the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To
        copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for
        the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source
        object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id
        response header in the response.

        If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that
        Amazon S3 generates is always null.

        If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, then you must restore a copy of this object
        before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request
        headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or
        provide your own encryption key.

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS-managed encryption
        key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-
          encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed customer master key (CMK) in KMS
          to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information on Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an encryption key that you
        provide, use the following headers.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        * If the source object is encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided
        encryption keys, you must use the following headers.

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-copy-source-​server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information on Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as
        canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        The following operation are related to ``CopyObject``

        *  PutObject

        *  GetObject

        Creates a new bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid
        AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
        buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

        Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming
        restrictions, see `Working with Amazon S3 Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html>`__ .

        By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) region. You can optionally
        specify a region in the request body. You might choose a region to optimize latency,
        minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe,
        you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the EU (Ireland) region. For
        more information, see `How to Select a Region for Your Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__ .

        .. note::

          If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request go to
          the us-east-1 region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must
          use us-east-1 as region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another
          region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a region other than US
          East (N. Virginia) region, your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more
          information, see `Virtual Hosting of Buckets
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`__ .

        When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or
        groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to
        grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

        * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
        permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3
        supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        .. note::

          You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
          both.

        The following operations are related to ``CreateBucket`` :

        *  PutObject

        *  DeleteBucket

        This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used
        to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID
        in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see  UploadPart ). You also include this
        upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.

        For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview

        If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload
        must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration.
        Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and
        Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete
        Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy

        `Multipart Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ .

        For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a
        multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart
        upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
        multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests
        (AWS Signature Version 4)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged
          for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
          Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing
          them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you
        access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS
        KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to
        provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in  UploadPart ) and
        UploadPartCopy ) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the
        upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` .

        To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have
        permission to the ``kms:Encrypt`` , ``kms:Decrypt`` , ``kms:ReEncrypt*`` ,
        ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` , and ``kms:DescribeKey`` actions on the key. These permissions are
        required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before
        it completes the multipart upload.

        If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as
        the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or
        role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both
        the key policy and your IAM user or role.

        For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in Amazon
        Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-
          encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the
          data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information on Server-Side Encryption with CMKs Stored in Amazon KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as
        canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
        request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
        suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

        The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
        provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
        version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
        delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
        response. Note that, if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns
        the result as deleted.

        The operation supports two modes for the response; verbose and quiet. By default, the
        operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
        key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
        operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any
        information about the delete in the response body.

        When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any
        versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
        request will fail, even if there are non versioned objects you are attempting to delete. If
        you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the
        entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA

        Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3
        uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not be altered in transit.

                  The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in
                  English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message
                  directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how
                  or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error
                  handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
                  message.

        acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state, if a state has never been
        set on the bucket.

                  ``GLACIER`` , or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class. If your bucket is
                  versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to
                  request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the
                  ``STANDARD_IA`` , ``ONEZONE_IA`` , ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING`` , ``GLACIER`` , or
                  ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

                  - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --*

          Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
          key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this
          section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that you
          can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies. If
          you are still using previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it works. For the
          earlier API description, see  GetBucketLifecycle .

        To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
        ``s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission, by default.

                  permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle
                  configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to
                  request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in
                  the object's lifetime.

                  - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --*

                    Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can

                  Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

                  - **ID** *(string) --*

                    A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.

                  - **Priority** *(integer) --*

                    The priority associated with the rule. If you specify multiple rules in a
                    replication configuration, Amazon S3 prioritizes the rules to prevent conflicts
                    when filtering. If two or more rules identify the same object based on a
                    specified filter, the rule with higher priority takes precedence. For example:

                    * Same object quality prefix based filter criteria If prefixes you specified in
                    multiple rules overlap

                    * Same object qualify tag based filter criteria specified in multiple rules

                    For more information, see `Replication <
                    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the
                    *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* .

                  - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                    An object keyname prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule
                    applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects
                    in a bucket, specify an empty string.

                  - **Filter** *(dict) --*

                    A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule
                    applies. A ``Filter`` must specify exactly one ``Prefix`` , ``Tag`` , or an
                    ``And`` child element.

                    - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                      An object keyname prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the
                      rule applies.

                    - **Tag** *(dict) --*

                      A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                      The rule applies only to objects that have the tag in their tag set.

                      - **Key** *(string) --*

                    - **And** *(dict) --*

                      A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of
                      objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you
                      specify more than one filter. For example:

                      * If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``Tag`` filter, wrap these filters in
                      an ``And`` tag.

                      * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``Tag`` elements in
                      an ``And`` tag.

                      - **Tags** *(list) --*

                        An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                        - *(dict) --*

                          A container of a key value name pair.

                          - **Key** *(string) --*

                            Name of the tag.

                          - **Value** *(string) --*

                            Value of the tag.

                  - **Status** *(string) --*

                    Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

                  - **SourceSelectionCriteria** *(dict) --*

                    A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects
                    that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication
                    of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports only the filter that you can
                    specify for objects created with server-side encryption using a customer master
                    key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

                    - **SseKmsEncryptedObjects** *(dict) --*

                      A container for filter information for the selection of Amazon S3 objects
                      encrypted with AWS KMS. If you include ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` in the
                      replication configuration, this element is required.

                      - **Status** *(string) --*

                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects created with server-side
                        encryption using a customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management
                        Service.

                  - **ExistingObjectReplication** *(dict) --*

                    A container that specifies information about existing object replication. You
                    can choose whether to enable or disable the replication of existing objects.

                    - **Status** *(string) --*

                      Specifies whether existing object replication is enabled.

                  - **Destination** *(dict) --*

                    A container for information about the replication destination.

                    - **Bucket** *(string) --*

                      the results.

                    - **Account** *(string) --*

                      Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you
                      direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the AWS account that owns the
                      destination bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property,
                      this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information,
                      see `Replication Additional Configuration\\: Change Replica Owner
                      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-change-owner.html>`__
                      in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

                    - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

                      The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as standard or reduced
                      redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object
                      to create the object replica.

                      For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the `PUT Bucket
                      replication
                      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__
                      action in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* .

                    - **AccessControlTranslation** *(dict) --*

                      Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination
                      bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to
                      the AWS account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in
                      the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same AWS account that
                      owns the source object.

                      - **Owner** *(string) --*

                        Specifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see `PUT
                        bucket replication
                        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__
                        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* .

                    - **EncryptionConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                      A container that provides information about encryption. If
                      ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` is specified, you must specify this element.

                      - **ReplicaKmsKeyID** *(string) --*

                        Specifies the AWS KMS Key ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) for the destination
                        bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects.

                    - **ReplicationTime** *(dict) --*

                      A container specifying the time when all objects and operations on objects are
                      replicated. Must be specified together with a ``Metrics`` block.

                      - **Status** *(string) --*

                        Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                      - **Time** *(dict) --*

                        A container specifying the time by which replication should complete for all
                        objects and operations on objects.

                        - **Minutes** *(integer) --*

                          Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                    - **Metrics** *(dict) --*

                      A container specifying replication metrics-related information, including
                      whether emitting metrics and Amazon S3 events for replication are enabled. In
                      addition, contains configurations related to specific metrics or events. Must
                      be specified together with a ``ReplicationTime`` block.

                      - **Status** *(string) --*

                        Specifies whether the replication metrics are enabled.

                      - **EventThreshold** *(dict) --*

                        A container specifying the time threshold for emitting the
                        ``s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold`` event.

                        - **Minutes** *(integer) --*

                          Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                  - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --*

                    Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates the delete markers. If you specify a
                    ``Filter`` , you must specify this element. However, in the latest version of
                    replication configuration (when ``Filter`` is specified), Amazon S3 doesn't
                    replicate delete markers. Therefore, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element can
                    contain only <Status>Disabled</Status>. For an example configuration, see `Basic
                    Rule Configuration
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`__
                    .

                    .. note::

                      If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3 assumes the replication
                      configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, Amazon S3
                      handled replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see
                      `Backward Compatibility

                    - **Status** *(string) --*

                      Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                      .. note::

                        In the current implementation, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate the delete
                        markers. The status must be ``Disabled`` .

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **RedirectAllRequestsTo** *(dict) --*

              Specifies the redirect behavior of all requests to a website endpoint of an Amazon S3
              bucket.

              - **HostName** *(string) --*

                Name of the host where requests are redirected.

              - **Protocol** *(string) --*

                Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used
                in the original request.

            - **IndexDocument** *(dict) --*

              The name of the index document for the website.

              - **Suffix** *(string) --*

                A suffix that is appended to a request that is for a directory on the website
                endpoint (e.g. if the suffix is index.html and you make a request to
                samplebucket/images/ the data that is returned will be for the object with the key
                name images/index.html) The suffix must not be empty and must not include a slash
                character.

            - **ErrorDocument** *(dict) --*

              The name of the error document for the website.

              - **Key** *(string) --*

                The object key name to use when a 4XX class error occurs.

            - **RoutingRules** *(list) --*

              Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior.

              - *(dict) --*

                Specifies the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied.

                - **Condition** *(dict) --*

                  A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect
                  to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder,
                  redirect to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx,
                  redirect request to another host where you might process the error.

                  - **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals** *(string) --*

                    The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if
                    the error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied.
                    Required when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling
                    ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is not specified. If both are specified, then both must be
                    true for the redirect to be applied.

                  - **KeyPrefixEquals** *(string) --*

                    The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to
                    redirect requests for ``ExamplePage.html`` , the key prefix will be
                    ``ExamplePage.html`` . To redirect request for all pages with the prefix
                    ``docs/`` , the key prefix will be ``/docs`` , which identifies all objects in
                    the docs/ folder. Required when the parent element ``Condition`` is specified
                    and sibling ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions
                    are specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

                - **Redirect** *(dict) --*

                  Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to
                  another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify
                  a different error code to return.

                  - **HostName** *(string) --*

                    The host name to use in the redirect request.

                  - **HttpRedirectCode** *(string) --*

                    The HTTP redirect code to use on the response. Not required if one of the
                    siblings is present.

                  - **Protocol** *(string) --*

                    Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is
                    used in the original request.

                  - **ReplaceKeyPrefixWith** *(string) --*

                    The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For example, to redirect
                    requests for all pages with prefix ``docs/`` (objects in the ``docs/`` folder)
                    to ``documents/`` , you can set a condition block with ``KeyPrefixEquals`` set
                    to ``docs/`` and in the Redirect set ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` to ``/documents``
                    . Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if
                    ``ReplaceKeyWith`` is not provided.

                  - **ReplaceKeyWith** *(string) --*

                    The specific object key to use in the redirect request. For example, redirect
                    request to ``error.html`` . Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can
                    be present only if ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` is not provided.

        Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the
        object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object
        without using an authorization header.

        An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer
        file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that
        imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can
        name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

        To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in
        the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object
        ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as
        ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the
        object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the
        resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information about
        request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__
        .

        To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent.
        For more information, see `Amazon S3 Torrent
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html>`__ . For more information
        about returning the ACL of an object, see  GetObjectAcl .

        If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes,
        before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this
        operation returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring
        archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ .

        Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
        GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your
        object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must
        use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
        ``s3:GetObjectVersionTagging`` action), the response also returns the
        ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the
        object. You can use  GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status
        code 403 ("access denied") error.

         **Versioning**

        By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a
        different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        .. note::

          If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the
          object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.

        For more information about versioning, see  PutBucketVersioning .

         **Overriding Response Header Values**

        There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response.
        For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET
        request.

        You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters.
        These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status
        code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a
        subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers
        that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` ,
        ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To
        override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

        .. note::

          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when
          using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

        * ``response-content-type``

        * ``response-content-language``

        * ``response-expires``

        * ``response-cache-control``

        * ``response-content-disposition``

        * ``response-content-encoding``

         **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**

        If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request
        as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since``
        condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

        If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the
        request as follows:``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified
        response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

              Object data.

            - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker.
              If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

            - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --*

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specifed.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the
              restored object copy.

            - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --*

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in x-amz-meta headers. This
              can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible
              metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose
              values are not legal HTTP headers.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              Version of the object.

              Specifies presentational information for the object.

            - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --*

              Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what
              decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the
              Content-Type header field.

            - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --*

              The language the content is in.

            - **ContentRange** *(string) --*

              A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

            - **Expires** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              The Server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3 (e.g.,

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer master
              key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

        The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself.
        This operation is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you
        must have READ access to the object.

        A ``HEAD`` request has the same options as a ``GET`` operation on an object. The response is
        identical to the ``GET`` response except that there is no response body.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata
        from the object, you must use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
          GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
          (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If
          your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see `Common Request
        Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html>`__ .

        Consider the following when using request headers:

        * Consideration 1 – If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are
        present in the request as follows:

          * ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;

          * ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ;

        Then Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and the data requested.

        * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are
        present in the request as follows:

          * ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;

          * ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ;

        Then Amazon S3 returns the ``304 Not Modified`` response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the s3:ListBucket permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return a HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return a HTTP status
        code 403 ("access denied") error.

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker.

            - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --*

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specifed.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the
              response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see
              RestoreObject or an archive copy is already restored.

              If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is
              scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

               ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date=
                   "Fri, 23 Dec 2012 00:00:00
               GMT"``

              If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value
              ``ongoing-request="true"`` .

              For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\\: General
              Considerations

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in x-amz-meta headers. This
              can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible
              metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose
              values are not legal HTTP headers.

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              If the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an AWS KMS customer
              master key (CMK) or an Amazon S3-managed encryption key, the response includes this
              header with the value of the Server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this
              object in S3 (e.g., AES256, aws:kms).

            - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer master
              key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

              For more information, see `Storage Classes
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ .

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --*

              Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a
              source or destination in a replication rule.

              In replication you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and
              destination bucket where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object
              (GetObject) or object metadata (HeadObject) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return
              the x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:

              * If requesting object from the source bucket — Amazon S3 will return the
              x-amz-replication-status header if object in your request is eligible for replication.
              For example, suppose in your replication configuration you specify object prefix
              "TaxDocs" requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix "TaxDocs". Then
              any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example "TaxDocs/document1.pdf",
              is eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix Amazon
              S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or
              FAILED indicating object replication status.

              * If requesting object from the destination bucket — Amazon S3 will return the
              x-amz-replication-status header with value REPLICA if object in your request is a
              replica that Amazon S3 created.

              For more information, see `Replication
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

            - **PartsCount** *(integer) --*

              The count of parts this object has.

            - **ObjectLockMode** *(string) --*

              The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission. For more
              information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__ .

            - **ObjectLockRetainUntilDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission.

            - **ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus** *(string) --*

              Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectLegalHold`` permission. This header is
              not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold
              applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock

        a time. Always check the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response. If there are no more
        configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to false. If there are more configurations to
        list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to true, and there is a value in ``NextContinuationToken`` .
        You use the ``NextContinuationToken`` value to continue the pagination of the list by
        passing the value in continuation-token in the request to ``GET`` the next page.

        To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
        ``s3:GetInventoryConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default.
        The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about
        permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations

        This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multipart upload is a
        multipart upload that has been initiated using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but
        has not yet been completed or aborted.

        This operation returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000 multipart
        uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which is also the default
        value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the
        ``max-uploads`` parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list
        criteria, the response will contain an ``IsTruncated`` element with the value true. To list
        the additional multipart uploads, use the ``key-marker`` and ``upload-id-marker`` request
        parameters.

        In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than
        one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first
        sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the
        upload initiation time.

        ::

          response = client.list_multipart_uploads(
              Bucket='string',
              Delimiter='string',
              EncodingType='url',
              KeyMarker='string',
              MaxUploads=123,
              Prefix='string',
              UploadIdMarker='string'
          )
        :type Bucket: string
        :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]**

          Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

        :type Delimiter: string
        :param Delimiter:

          Character you use to group keys.

          All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first
          occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element,
          ``CommonPrefixes`` . If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts
          at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under ``CommonPrefixes`` result
          element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

        :type EncodingType: string
        :param EncodingType:

          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding
          method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser
          cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that
          Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

        :type KeyMarker: string
        :param KeyMarker:

          Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which
          listing should begin.

          If ``upload-id-marker`` is not specified, only the keys lexicographically greater than the
          specified ``key-marker`` will be included in the list.

          If ``upload-id-marker`` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the
          ``key-marker`` might also be included, provided those multipart uploads have upload IDs
          lexicographically greater than the specified ``upload-id-marker`` .

        :type MaxUploads: integer
        :param MaxUploads:

          Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response
          body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be returned in a response.

        :type Prefix: string
        :param Prefix:

          Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You
          can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of
          using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

        :type UploadIdMarker: string
        :param UploadIdMarker:

          Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.
          If key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any
          multipart uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if
          they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified upload-id-marker.

              key-marker request parameter in a subsequent request.

            - **Prefix** *(string) --*

              When a prefix is provided in the request, this field contains the specified prefix.
              The result contains only keys starting with the specified prefix.

            - **Delimiter** *(string) --*

              Contains the delimiter you specified in the request. If you don't specify a delimiter
              in your request, this element is absent from the response.

            - **NextUploadIdMarker** *(string) --*

              When a list is truncated, this element specifies the value that should be used for the
              upload-id-marker request parameter in a subsequent request.

            - **MaxUploads** *(integer) --*

              Maximum number of multipart uploads that could have been included in the response.

            - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

              Indicates whether the returned list of multipart uploads is truncated. A value of true
              indicates that the list was truncated. The list can be truncated if the number of
              multipart uploads exceeds the limit allowed or specified by max uploads.

            - **Uploads** *(list) --*

              Container for elements related to a particular multipart upload. A response can
              contain zero or more Upload elements.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for the MultipartUpload for the Amazon S3 object.

                - **UploadId** *(string) --*

                  Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.

                - **Initiated** *(datetime) --*

                    Container for the display name of the owner

                  - **ID** *(string) --*

                    Container for the ID of the owner

                - **Initiator** *(dict) --*

                  Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

                  - **ID** *(string) --*

                    If the principal is an AWS account, it provides the Canonical User ID. If the
                    principal is an IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

                  - **DisplayName** *(string) --*

                    Name of the Principal.

            - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --*

              If you specify a delimiter in the request, then the result returns each distinct key
              prefix containing the delimiter in a CommonPrefixes element. The distinct key prefixes
              are returned in the Prefix child element.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of
                the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like
                subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is
                notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix
                is notes/summer/.

                - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                  Container for the specified common prefix.

            - **EncodingType** *(string) --*

              Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the response.

              If you specify ``encoding-type`` request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in
              the response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

          The name of the bucket that contains the objects.

        :type Delimiter: string
        :param Delimiter:

          A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same
          string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under
          a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against
          the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

        :type EncodingType: string
        :param EncodingType:

          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding
          method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser
          cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For

          Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.

        :type MaxKeys: integer
        :param MaxKeys:

          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response might contain fewer
          keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were
          not returned because max-keys was exceeded, the response contains
          <isTruncated>true</isTruncated>. To return the additional keys, see key-marker and
          version-id-marker.

        :type Prefix: string
        :param Prefix:

          Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can
          use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of
          using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can
          use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under
          CommonPrefixes.

            - **Delimiter** *(string) --*

              The delimeter grouping the included keys. A delimiter is a character that you specify
              to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first
              occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in
              CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the max-keys

                the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like
                subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is
                notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix
                is notes/summer/.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

              A flag that indicates whether or not Amazon S3 returned all of the results that
              satisfied the search criteria.

            - **Marker** *(string) --*

              Indicates where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in the response if it
              was sent with the request.

            - **NextMarker** *(string) --*

              When response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the response is true),
              you can use the key name in this field as marker in the subsequent request to get next
              set of objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order Note: This element is
              returned only if you have delimiter request parameter specified. If response does not
              include the NextMaker and it is truncated, you can use the value of the last Key in
              the response as the marker in the subsequent request to get the next set of object
              keys.

            - **Contents** *(list) --*

              Metadata about each object returned.

              - *(dict) --*

                An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the
                  object.

                - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

                  The date the Object was Last Modified

                - **ETag** *(string) --*

                  The entity tag is an MD5 hash of the object. ETag reflects only changes to the
                  contents of an object, not its metadata.

                - **Size** *(integer) --*

                  Size in bytes of the object

                - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

                  The class of storage used to store the object.

                - **Owner** *(dict) --*

                  The owner of the object

                  - **DisplayName** *(string) --*

                    Container for the ID of the owner

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              Name of the bucket.

            - **Prefix** *(string) --*

              Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

            - **Delimiter** *(string) --*

              Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence
              of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the CommonPrefixes
              collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each
              rolled-up result counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

            - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --*

              The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

            - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --*

              All of the keys rolled up in a common prefix count as a single return when calculating
              the number of returns.

              A response can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delimiter.

              CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next
              occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter.

              CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by
              Prefix.

              For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in
              notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. All of the keys that roll up
              into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of
                the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --*

              Set to false if all of the results were returned. Set to true if more keys are
              available to return. If the number of results exceeds that specified by MaxKeys, all
              of the results might not be returned.

            - **Contents** *(list) --*

              Metadata about each object returned.

              - *(dict) --*

                An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the
                  object.

                - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

                  The date the Object was Last Modified

                - **ETag** *(string) --*

                  The entity tag is an MD5 hash of the object. ETag reflects only changes to the
                  contents of an object, not its metadata.

                - **Size** *(integer) --*

                  Size in bytes of the object

                - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

                  The class of storage used to store the object.

                - **Owner** *(dict) --*

                  The owner of the object

                  - **DisplayName** *(string) --*

                    Container for the display name of the owner

                  - **ID** *(string) --*

                    Container for the ID of the owner

            - **Name** *(string) --*

              Name of the bucket.

            - **Prefix** *(string) --*

              Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

            - **Delimiter** *(string) --*

              Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence
              of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the CommonPrefixes
              collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each
              rolled-up result counts as only one return against the MaxKeys value.

            - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --*

              Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response might contain
              fewer keys but will never contain more.

            - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --*

              All of the keys rolled up into a common prefix count as a single return when
              calculating the number of returns.

              A response can contain ``CommonPrefixes`` only if you specify a delimiter.

               ``CommonPrefixes`` contains all (if there are any) keys between ``Prefix`` and the
               next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.

               ``CommonPrefixes`` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified
               by ``Prefix`` .

              For example, if the prefix is ``notes/`` and the delimiter is a slash (``/`` ) as in
              ``notes/summer/july`` , the common prefix is ``notes/summer/`` . All of the keys that
              roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of
              returns.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of
                the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like
                subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is
                notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix
                is notes/summer/.

                - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                  Container for the specified common prefix.

            - **EncodingType** *(string) --*

              Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the XML response.

              If you specify the encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in
              the response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

               ``Delimiter, Prefix, Key,`` and ``StartAfter`` .

            - **KeyCount** *(integer) --*

              KeyCount is the number of keys returned with this request. KeyCount will always be
              less than equals to MaxKeys field. Say you ask for 50 keys, your result will include
              less than equals 50 keys

            - **ContinuationToken** *(string) --*

              If ContinuationToken was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

            - **NextContinuationToken** *(string) --*

              NextContinuationToken is sent when isTruncated is true which means there are more keys
              in the bucket that can be listed. The next list requests to Amazon S3 can be continued
              with this NextContinuationToken. NextContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not a real
              key

            - **StartAfter** *(string) --*

              If StartAfter was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

          You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.

        Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either
        the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that
        updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.

         **Access Permissions**

        You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
        permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header,
        you cannot use other access control specific headers in your request. For more information,
        see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. When using these headers you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS
        accounts or a Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL
        specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map
        to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see
        `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete
        objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts
        identified by their email addresses.

         ``x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery",
         emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
        </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``

        Sets the ``cors`` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3
        replaces it.

        To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the ``s3:PutBucketCORS`` action. By
        default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

        You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests.
        For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is ``http://www.example.com``
        to access your Amazon S3 bucket at ``my.example.bucket.com`` by using the browser's
        ``XMLHttpRequest`` capability.

        To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the ``cors`` subresource
        to the bucket. The ``cors`` subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that
        identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is
        limited to 64 KB in size.

        When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a
        bucket, it evaluates the ``cors`` configuration on the bucket and uses the first
        ``CORSRule`` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin
        request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

        * The request's ``Origin`` header must match ``AllowedOrigin`` elements.

        * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD and so on) or the
        ``Access-Control-Request-Method`` header in case of a pre-flight ``OPTIONS`` request must be
        one of the ``AllowedMethod`` elements.

        * Every header specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` request header of a
        pre-flight request must match an ``AllowedHeader`` element.

        .. note::

          Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
          key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this
          section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering
          based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
          For the related API description, see  PutBucketLifecycle .

         **Rules**

        You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is
        specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule consists of the following:

        * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based
        on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both.

        * Status whether the rule is in effect.

        * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform
        on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled
        or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version
        and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can
        specify for current and noncurrent object versions.

        For more information, see `Object Lifecycle Management
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ and
        `Lifecycle Configuration Elements
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__ .

         **Permissions**

        By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related
        subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the
        resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created it) can access the resource. The
        resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access
        policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.

        You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other
        permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from
        your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

        * s3:DeleteObject

        * s3:DeleteObjectVersion

        * s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration

        For more information about permissions, see `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
        Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html>`__ .

        Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and
        modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as the
        source bucket. To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

        The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the Grantee
        request element to grant access to other people. The Permissions request element specifies
        the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>

        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``

        To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request elements. To disable
        logging, you use an empty BucketLoggingStatus request element:

         ``<BucketLoggingStatus xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01" />``

        Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event
        notifications, see `Configuring Event Notifications
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

        Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is
        an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the
        destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an
        event of the specified type.

        By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification
        configuration will be an empty ``NotificationConfiguration`` .

         ``<NotificationConfiguration>``

         ``</NotificationConfiguration>``

        This operation replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you
        include in the request body.

        After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification
        Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and
        that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the
        case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions
        grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more
        information, see `Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

        You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.

        By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket
        owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration
        with ``s3:PutBucketNotification`` permission.

        .. note::

          The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
          configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you
          send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS
          topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT operation will fail, and Amazon S3 will not
          add the configuration to your bucket.

         **Responses**

        If the configuration in the request body includes only one ``TopicConfiguration`` specifying
        only the *s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject* event type, the response will also include the
        *x-amz-sns-test-message-id* header containing the message ID of the test notification sent
        to topic.

        *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* .

        .. note::

          To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation must have the
          `iam\\:PassRole
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html>`__
          permission.

        Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration,
        you provide the name of the destination bucket where you want Amazon S3 to replicate
        objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and
        other relevant information.

        A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of
        1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the
        source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each
        subset. All rules must specify the same destination bucket.

        To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add
        the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object
        key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
        configuration, you must also add the following elements: ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ,
        ``Status`` , and ``Priority`` .

        By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the bucket, can
        perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the

         **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**

        By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side
        encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the
        following: ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` , ``SseKmsEncryptedObjects`` , ``Status`` ,
        ``EncryptionConfiguration`` , and ``ReplicaKmsKeyID`` . For information about replication
        configuration, see `Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS KMS

            least one rule and can contain a maximum of 1,000 rules.

            - *(dict) --*

              Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

              - **ID** *(string) --*

                A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.

              - **Priority** *(integer) --*

                The priority associated with the rule. If you specify multiple rules in a
                replication configuration, Amazon S3 prioritizes the rules to prevent conflicts when
                filtering. If two or more rules identify the same object based on a specified
                filter, the rule with higher priority takes precedence. For example:

                * Same object quality prefix based filter criteria If prefixes you specified in
                multiple rules overlap

                * Same object qualify tag based filter criteria specified in multiple rules

                For more information, see `Replication <
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon
                S3 Developer Guide* .

              - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                An object keyname prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule
                applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a
                bucket, specify an empty string.

              - **Filter** *(dict) --*

                A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule
                applies. A ``Filter`` must specify exactly one ``Prefix`` , ``Tag`` , or an ``And``
                child element.

                - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                  An object keyname prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule
                  applies.

                - **Tag** *(dict) --*

                  A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                  The rule applies only to objects that have the tag in their tag set.

                  - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Name of the tag.

                  - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                - **And** *(dict) --*

                  A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of
                  objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you specify
                  more than one filter. For example:

                  * If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``Tag`` filter, wrap these filters in an
                  ``And`` tag.

                  * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``Tag`` elements in an
                  ``And`` tag.

                  - **Prefix** *(string) --*

                    An object keyname prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule
                    applies.

                  - **Tags** *(list) --*

                    An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                    - *(dict) --*

                        Value of the tag.

              - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

              - **SourceSelectionCriteria** *(dict) --*

                A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects
                that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of
                these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports only the filter that you can specify
                for objects created with server-side encryption using a customer master key (CMK)
                stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

                - **SseKmsEncryptedObjects** *(dict) --*

                  A container for filter information for the selection of Amazon S3 objects
                  encrypted with AWS KMS. If you include ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` in the
                  replication configuration, this element is required.

                  - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects created with server-side
                    encryption using a customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management
                    Service.

              - **ExistingObjectReplication** *(dict) --*

                A container that specifies information about existing object replication. You can
                choose whether to enable or disable the replication of existing objects.

                - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  Specifies whether existing object replication is enabled.

              - **Destination** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                A container for information about the replication destination.

                - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store the
                  results.

                - **Account** *(string) --*

                  Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct
                  Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the AWS account that owns the destination
                  bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, this is the
                  account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see `Replication
                  Additional Configuration\\: Change Replica Owner
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-change-owner.html>`__
                  in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

                - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

                  The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as standard or reduced
                  redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to
                  create the object replica.

                  For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the `PUT Bucket replication
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__
                  action in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* .

                - **AccessControlTranslation** *(dict) --*

                  Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket
                  owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the AWS
                  account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the
                  replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same AWS account that owns
                  the source object.

                  - **Owner** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Specifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see `PUT bucket
                    replication
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__
                    in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* .

                - **EncryptionConfiguration** *(dict) --*

                  A container that provides information about encryption. If
                  ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` is specified, you must specify this element.

                  - **ReplicaKmsKeyID** *(string) --*

                    Specifies the AWS KMS Key ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) for the destination bucket.
                    Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects.

                - **ReplicationTime** *(dict) --*

                  A container specifying the time when all objects and operations on objects are
                  replicated. Must be specified together with a ``Metrics`` block.

                  - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                  - **Time** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    A container specifying the time by which replication should complete for all
                    objects and operations on objects.

                    - **Minutes** *(integer) --*

                      Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                - **Metrics** *(dict) --*

                  A container specifying replication metrics-related information, including whether
                  emitting metrics and Amazon S3 events for replication are enabled. In addition,
                  contains configurations related to specific metrics or events. Must be specified
                  together with a ``ReplicationTime`` block.

                  - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Specifies whether the replication metrics are enabled.

                  - **EventThreshold** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    A container specifying the time threshold for emitting the
                    ``s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold`` event.

                    - **Minutes** *(integer) --*

                      Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

              - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --*

                Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates the delete markers. If you specify a
                ``Filter`` , you must specify this element. However, in the latest version of
                replication configuration (when ``Filter`` is specified), Amazon S3 doesn't
                replicate delete markers. Therefore, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element can
                contain only <Status>Disabled</Status>. For an example configuration, see `Basic
                Rule Configuration
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`__
                .

                .. note::

                  If you don't specify the Filter element, Amazon S3 assumes the replication
                  configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, Amazon S3
                  handled replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see
                  `Backward Compatibility
                  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__
                  .

                - **Status** *(string) --*

                  Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                  .. note::

                    In the current implementation, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate the delete markers.
                    The status must be ``Disabled`` .

        them the ``S3:PutBucketWebsite`` permission.

        To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website
        configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website,

        routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the
        redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document
        for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected.

              The object key name to use when a 4XX class error occurs.

          - **IndexDocument** *(dict) --*

            The name of the index document for the website.

            - **Suffix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              A suffix that is appended to a request that is for a directory on the website endpoint
              (e.g. if the suffix is index.html and you make a request to samplebucket/images/ the
              data that is returned will be for the object with the key name images/index.html) The
              suffix must not be empty and must not include a slash character.

          - **RedirectAllRequestsTo** *(dict) --*

            The redirect behavior for every request to this bucket's website endpoint.

            .. warning::

              If you specify this property, you can't specify any other property.

            - **HostName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              Name of the host where requests are redirected.

            - **Protocol** *(string) --*

              Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in
              the original request.

          - **RoutingRules** *(list) --*

            Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior.

            - *(dict) --*

              Specifies the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied.

              - **Condition** *(dict) --*

                A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect
                to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect
                to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect
                request to another host where you might process the error.

                - **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals** *(string) --*

                  The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the
                  error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied. Required
                  when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is
                  not specified. If both are specified, then both must be true for the redirect to
                  be applied.

                - **KeyPrefixEquals** *(string) --*

                  The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to redirect
                  requests for ``ExamplePage.html`` , the key prefix will be ``ExamplePage.html`` .
                  To redirect request for all pages with the prefix ``docs/`` , the key prefix will
                  be ``/docs`` , which identifies all objects in the docs/ folder. Required when the
                  parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling
                  ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are
                  specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

              - **Redirect** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to
                another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a
                different error code to return.

                - **HostName** *(string) --*

                  The host name to use in the redirect request.

                - **HttpRedirectCode** *(string) --*

                  The HTTP redirect code to use on the response. Not required if one of the siblings

                  used in the original request.

                - **ReplaceKeyPrefixWith** *(string) --*

                  The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For example, to redirect
                  requests for all pages with prefix ``docs/`` (objects in the ``docs/`` folder) to
                  ``documents/`` , you can set a condition block with ``KeyPrefixEquals`` set to
                  ``docs/`` and in the Redirect set ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` to ``/documents`` . Not
                  required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if
                  ``ReplaceKeyWith`` is not provided.

                - **ReplaceKeyWith** *(string) --*

                  The specific object key to use in the redirect request. For example, redirect
                  request to ``error.html`` . Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be

        Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to
        it.

        Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the
        entire object to the bucket.

        Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same
        object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not
        provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer
        or use versioning instead.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header.
        When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if
        they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting
        an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

        .. note::

          To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body,
          use the ``100-continue`` HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid
          sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example,
          because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the
          ``100-continue`` HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of
          `http\\://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt>`__ .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when
        you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS-managed
        encryption keys. For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific
        permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request
        headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify
        the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-
          encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the
          data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information on Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as
        canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          .. warning::

             Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS
             Regions:

              * US East (N. Virginia)

              * US West (N. California)

              * US West (Oregon)

              * Asia Pacific (Singapore)

              * Asia Pacific (Sydney)

              * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

              * EU (Ireland)

              * South America (São Paulo)

            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported regions and endpoints, see `Regions and
            Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the
            AWS General Reference

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-
          encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the default AWS KMS CMK to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information on Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

        .. note::

           If you use this feature, the ETag value that Amazon S3 returns in the response is not the
           MD5 of the object.

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

         **Storage Class Options**

        By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly created objects. The
        Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other
        storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the
        Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

         **Versioning**

        If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID
        for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the
        ``x-amz-version-id response`` header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null
        as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning
        state of a bucket, see  GetBucketVersioning . If you enable versioning for a bucket, when
        Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all
        of the objects.

        uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for an object that
        already exists in a bucket. You must have WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object.

        Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on an object using either
        the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that
        updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.

         **Access Permissions**

        You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
        permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header,
        you cannot use other access control specific headers in your request. For more information,
        see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. When using these headers you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS
        accounts or a Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL
        specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map
        to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see
        `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two
        AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
        </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=

        The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the
        current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the ``versionId``
        subresource.

            Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this
            bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following
            behavior:

            * PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified ACL is public.

            * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

            * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

            Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --*

            Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in
            this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs
            on this bucket and objects in this bucket.

            Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't
            prevent new public ACLs from being set.

          - **BlockPublicPolicy** *(boolean) --*

            Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting
            this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the
            specified bucket policy allows public access.

            Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

         **Querying Archives with Select Requests**

        You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived
        objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed
        comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your
        archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
        overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, do the following:

        * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket
        in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried.
        The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You
        can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket.
        For more information about output, see `Querying Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* . For more information about the ``S3``
        structure in the request body, see the following:

          *  PutObject

          * `Managing Access with ACLs

          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*

        * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the
        request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following
        examples.

          * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM
          Object``

          * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can
          specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 >
          100``

          * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the
          request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the
          ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You
          cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN
          FROM S3Object s``

        Amazon S3 Select and Glacier Select
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, you can also do the following:

        * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about
        tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

        * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being
        queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.

        The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

        * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored
        until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.

        * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't
        deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.

        * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select
        request doesn’t return error response ``409`` .

         **Restoring Archives**

        Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived
        object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the
        archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the
        restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but
        the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was
        restored from.

        To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a
        version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

        The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being
        restored from and which data access tier you specify.

        When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the
        following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body:

        * **``Expedited`` ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in
        the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are
        required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
        retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
        that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
        retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Standard`` ** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
        within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval
        requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete
        within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from
        the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Bulk`` ** - Bulk retrievals are Amazon Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option,
        enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk
        retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically
        complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for
        ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed
        while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing
        another restore request to the same object, setting a new ``Tier`` request element. When
        issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than
        the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters,
        such as the ``Days`` request element. For more information, see `Upgrading the Speed of an
        In-Progress Restore
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return
        the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in
        the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is
        initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the
        request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current
        time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update
        the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request
        for the object.

        If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action,
        the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For
        example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in
        3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle
        configuration, see  PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and `Object Lifecycle Management
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Responses**

        A successful operation returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code.

        * If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in
        the response.

        * If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.

         **Special Errors**

        *

          * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*

          * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type
          requests.)*

          * *Cause: Glacier expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later.
          (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to process the Expedited request. This error
          applies only to Expedited retrievals and not to Standard or Bulk retrievals.)*

        This operation filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured
        query language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also
        specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3
        uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the
        specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the
        response.

        For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see `Selecting Content from Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/selecting-content-from-objects.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        For more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see `SQL Reference for Amazon S3
        Select and Glacier Select
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Permissions**

        You must have ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. Amazon S3 Select does not
        support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see `Specifying
        Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         *Object Data Formats*

        You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:

        * *CSV, JSON, and Parquet* - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.

        * *UTF-8* - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.

        * *GZIP or BZIP2* - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2
        are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files.
        Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3
        Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.

        * *Server-side encryption* - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected
        with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided
        encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are
        documented in the  GetObject . For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption
        (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* . For objects that are encrypted with
        Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't
        need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including
        SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Working with the Response Body**

        Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of
        messages and includes a ``Transfer-Encoding`` header with ``chunked`` as its value in the
        response. For more information, see  RESTSelectObjectAppendix .

         **GetObject Support**

        The ``SelectObjectContent`` operation does not support the following ``GetObject``
        functionality. For more information, see  GetObject .

        * ``Range`` : While you can specify a scan range for a Amazon S3 Select request, see
        SelectObjectContentRequest$ScanRange in the request parameters below, you cannot specify the
        range of bytes of an object to return.

        * GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You cannot specify the
        GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or ``REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`` storage classes. For more information,
        about storage classes see `Storage Classes
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#storage-class-intro>`__
        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

            - **QuoteEscapeCharacter** *(string) --*

              The single character used for escaping the quote character inside an already escaped
              value.

            - **RecordDelimiter** *(string) --*

              A single character used to separate individual records in the output. Instead of the

        :type ScanRange: dict
        :param ScanRange:

          Specifies the byte range of the object to get the records from. A record is processed when
          its first byte is contained by the range. This parameter is optional, but when specified,
          it must not be empty. See RFC 2616, Section 14.35.1 about how to specify the start and end
          of the range.

           ``ScanRange`` may be used in the following ways:

          * ``<scanrange><start>50</start><end>100</end></scanrange>`` - process only the records
          starting between the bytes 50 and 100 (inclusive, counting from zero)

          * ``<scanrange><start>50</start></scanrange>`` - process only the records starting after
          the byte 50

          * ``<scanrange><end>50</end></scanrange>`` - process only the records within the last 50
          bytes of the file.

          - **Start** *(integer) --*

            Specifies the start of the byte range. This parameter is optional. Valid values:
            non-negative integers. The default value is 0. If only start is supplied, it means scan
            from that point to the end of the file.For example;
            ``<scanrange><start>50</start></scanrange>`` means scan from byte 50 until the end of
            the file.

          - **End** *(integer) --*

            Specifies the end of the byte range. This parameter is optional. Valid values:
            non-negative integers. The default value is one less than the size of the object being
            queried. If only the End parameter is supplied, it is interpreted to mean scan the last
            N bytes of the file. For example; ``<scanrange><end>50</end></scanrange>`` means scan
            the last 50 bytes.

        :rtype: dict
        :returns:

          The response of this operation contains an :class:`.EventStream` member. When iterated the

        Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

        .. note::

          In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to
          specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To
          upload a part from an existing object, you use the  UploadPartCopy operation.

        You must initiate a multipart upload (see  CreateMultipartUpload ) before you can upload any
        part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique
        identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.

        Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely
        identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you
        upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the
        previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the
        last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the
        ``Content-MD5`` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against
        the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.

         **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either
         complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the
         uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees
         up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

        For more information on multipart uploads, go to `Multipart Upload Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple
        Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to
        `Multipart Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have
        the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS-managed encryption
        keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in
        the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using
        CreateMultipartUpload . For more information, go to `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using
        a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in
        each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server side encryption
        parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
        CreateMultipartUpload .

        If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your
        initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each
        part upload using the following headers.

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

         **Special Errors**

        Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data
        source by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source`` in your request and a byte range
        by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source-range`` in your request.

        The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about
        multipart upload limits, go to `Quick Facts
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple
        Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        .. note::

          Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the  UploadPart operation
          and provide data in your request.

        You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your
        initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must
        include in your upload part request.

         **For more information on using the UploadPartCopy operation, see the following topics:**

        * For conceptual information on multipart uploads, go to `Uploading Objects Using Multipart
        Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        * For information on permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to `Multipart
        Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        * For information about copying objects using a single atomic operation vs. the multipart
        upload, go to `Operations on Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        * For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys
        with the UploadPartCopy operation, see  CopyObject and  UploadPart .

        Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``

        * **Consideration 1** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3
        returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data.

        * **Consideration 2** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns
        ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code.

         **Versioning**

        If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object.
        By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of the object to copy. If
        the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the
        ``x-amz-copy-source`` , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If
        you specify versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` and the versionId is a delete marker,
        Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker
        as a version for the ``x-amz-copy-source`` .

        You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the
        ``versionId`` subresource as shown in the following example:

         ``x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id``
