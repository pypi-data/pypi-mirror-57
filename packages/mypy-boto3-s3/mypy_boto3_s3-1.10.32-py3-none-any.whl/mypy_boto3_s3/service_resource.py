        Creates a new bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid
        AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
        buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

        Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming
        restrictions, see `Working with Amazon S3 Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html>`__ .

        By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally
        specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency,
        minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe,
        you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the EU (Ireland) Region. For
        more information, see `How to Select a Region for Your Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__ .

        .. note::

          If you send your create bucket request to the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` endpoint, the request
          goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version
          4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request
          specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a
          Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307
          redirect. For more information, see `Virtual Hosting of Buckets
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`__ .

        When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or
        groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to
        grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

        * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees
        and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and
        ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3
        supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        .. note::

          You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
          both.

        The following operations are related to ``CreateBucket`` :

        *  PutObject

        *  DeleteBucket

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3-2006-03-01/CreateBucket>`_

            bucket = s3.Bucket('otherbucket')
            bucket.copy(copy_source, 'otherkey')

        :type CopySource: dict
        :param CopySource: The name of the source bucket, key name of the
            source object, and optional version ID of the source object. The
            dictionary format is:
            ``{'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}``. Note
            that the ``VersionId`` key is optional and may be omitted.

        :type Key: str
        :param Key: The name of the key to copy to

        :type ExtraArgs: dict
        :param ExtraArgs: Extra arguments that may be passed to the
            client operation

        :type Callback: function
        :param Callback: A method which takes a number of bytes transferred to
            be periodically called during the copy.

        :type SourceClient: botocore or boto3 Client
        :param SourceClient: The client to be used for operation that
            may happen at the source object. For example, this client is
            used for the head_object that determines the size of the copy.
            If no client is provided, the current client is used as the client
            for the source object.

        :type Config: boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig
        :param Config: The transfer configuration to be used when performing the

        Creates a new bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid
        AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
        buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

        Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information on bucket naming
        restrictions, see `Working with Amazon S3 Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html>`__ .

        By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally
        specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency,
        minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe,
        you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the EU (Ireland) Region. For
        more information, see `How to Select a Region for Your Buckets
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__ .

        .. note::

          If you send your create bucket request to the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` endpoint, the request
          goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version
          4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request
          specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a
          Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307
          redirect. For more information, see `Virtual Hosting of Buckets
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`__ .

        When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or
        groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to
        grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

        * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees
        and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and
        ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3
        supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        .. note::

          You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
          both.

        *  PutObject

        This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
        request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
        suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

        The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
        provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
        version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
        delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
        response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns
        the result as deleted.

        The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
        operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
        key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
        operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any
        information about the delete in the response body.

        When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any
        versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
        request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
        provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire
        Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__
        .

        Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3
        uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

                  The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in
                  English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message
                  directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how
                  or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error
                  handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
                  message.

        Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to
        it.

        Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the
        entire object to the bucket.

        Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same
        object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not
        provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer
        or use versioning instead.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header.
        When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if
        they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting
        an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

        .. note::

          To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body,
          use the ``100-continue`` HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid
          sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example,
          because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the
          ``100-continue`` HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of
          `http\\://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt>`__ .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when
        you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed
        encryption keys. For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific
        permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request
        headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in
          AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          .. warning::

             Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS
             Regions:

              * US East (N. Virginia)

              * US West (N. California)

              * US West (Oregon)

              * Asia Pacific (Singapore)

              * Asia Pacific (Sydney)

              * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

              * EU (Ireland)

              * South America (São Paulo)

            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and
            Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the
            AWS General Reference

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the default AWS KMS CMK
          to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

        .. note::

           If you use this feature, the ETag value that Amazon S3 returns in the response is not the
           MD5 of the object.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

         **Storage Class Options**

        By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly created objects. The
        Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other
        storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the
        Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

         **Versioning**

        If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID
        for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the
        ``x-amz-version-id response`` header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null
        as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning
        state of a bucket, see  GetBucketVersioning . If you enable versioning for a bucket, when
        Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all
        of the objects.

            - *(string) --*

        :type ServerSideEncryption: string
        :param ServerSideEncryption:

          The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for
          example, AES256, aws:kms).

        :type StorageClass: string
        :param StorageClass:

          If you don't specify, Standard is the default storage class. Amazon S3 supports other
          storage classes.

        :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string
        :param WebsiteRedirectLocation:

          If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another
          object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header
          in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and
          Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`__ .

          In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object
          (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

           ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html``

          In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:

           ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/``

        :type SSECustomerKey: string
        :param SSECustomerKey:

          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
          This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store
          the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in
          the ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm`` header.

        :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
        :param SSECustomerKeyMD5:

          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3
          uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was
          transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided.
            Including this parameter is not required

        :type SSEKMSKeyId: string
        :param SSEKMSKeyId:

          If ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` is present and has the value of ``aws:kms`` , this
          header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key
          (CMK) that was used for the object.

          If the value of ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` is ``aws:kms`` , this header specifies
          the ID of the AWS KMS CMK that will be used for the object. If you specify
          ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but do not
          provide``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed
          CMK in AWS to protect the data.

        :type SSEKMSEncryptionContext: string
        :param SSEKMSEncryptionContext:

          Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this
          header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value
          pairs.

        :type RequestPayer: string
        :param RequestPayer:

          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the request. Bucket
          owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about
          downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requestor
          Pays Buckets

          in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* .

        :type Tagging: string
        :param Tagging:

          The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For
          example, "Key1=Value1")

        :type ObjectLockMode: string
        :param ObjectLockMode:

          The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.

        :type ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: datetime
        :param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate:

          The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.

        information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . To set the ACL
        of a bucket, you must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission.

        You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:

        * Specify the ACL in the request body

        * Specify permissions using request headers

        .. note::

          You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.

        Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either
        the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that
        updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.

         **Access Permissions**

        You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees
        and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-acl`` . If you use this
        header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS
        accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
        headers, you cannot use the ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map
        to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see
        `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-write`` header grants create, overwrite, and delete
        objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts
        identified by their email addresses.

         ``x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery",
         emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
        </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``

        Sets the ``cors`` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3
        replaces it.

        To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the ``s3:PutBucketCORS`` action. By
        default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

        You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests.
        For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is ``http://www.example.com``
        to access your Amazon S3 bucket at ``my.example.bucket.com`` by using the browser's
        ``XMLHttpRequest`` capability.

        To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the ``cors`` subresource
        to the bucket. The ``cors`` subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that
        identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is
        limited to 64 KB in size.

        When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a
        bucket, it evaluates the ``cors`` configuration on the bucket and uses the first
        ``CORSRule`` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin
        request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

        * The request's ``Origin`` header must match ``AllowedOrigin`` elements.

        * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the
        ``Access-Control-Request-Method`` header in case of a pre-flight ``OPTIONS`` request must be
        one of the ``AllowedMethod`` elements.

        * Every header specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` request header of a
        pre-flight request must match an ``AllowedHeader`` element.

                Headers that are specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` header. These
                headers are allowed in a preflight OPTIONS request. In response to any preflight
                OPTIONS request, Amazon S3 returns any requested headers that are allowed.

                - *(string) --*

              - **AllowedMethods** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                An HTTP method that you allow the origin to execute. Valid values are ``GET`` ,

        By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and related subresources
        (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private. Only the
        resource owner, the AWS account that created the resource, can access it. The resource owner
        can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this
        operation, users must get the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` permission.

        You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also supersedes any other
        permissions. If you want to prevent users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from
        your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

        * ``s3:DeleteObject``

        * ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion``

        * ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration``

                  value must be a non-zero positive integer.

                - **ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

                  Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker with no noncurrent
                  versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be expired; if set to false the
                  policy takes no action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle

                Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class.

                - **Date** *(datetime) --*

                  Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date
                  value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

                - **Days** *(integer) --*

                  Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the
                  specified storage class. The value must be a positive integer.

                - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

                permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle
                configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to
                request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the
                object's lifetime.

                - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --*

                  Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
          key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this
          section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering
          based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
          For the related API description, see  PutBucketLifecycle .

         **Rules**

        You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is
        specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule consists of the following:

        * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based
        on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both.

        * Status whether the rule is in effect.

        * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform
        on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled
        or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version
        and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can
        specify for current and noncurrent object versions.

        For more information, see `Object Lifecycle Management
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ and
        `Lifecycle Configuration Elements
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__ .

         **Permissions**

        By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related
        subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the
        resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created it) can access the resource. The
        resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access
        policy. For this operation, a user must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.

        You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other
        permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from
        your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

        * s3:DeleteObject

        * s3:DeleteObjectVersion

        * s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration

        For more information about permissions, see `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
        Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html>`__ .

                Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3
                permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle
                configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to
                request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the
                object's lifetime.

                - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --*

                  Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform
                  the associated action. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see

        Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and
        modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as the
        source bucket. To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

        The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the ``Grantee``
        request element to grant access to other people. The ``Permissions`` request element
        specifies the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
        </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.

        * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``

        To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request elements. To disable
        logging, you use an empty BucketLoggingStatus request element:

         ``<BucketLoggingStatus xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01" />``

            Describes where logs are stored and the prefix that Amazon S3 assigns to all log object
            keys for a bucket. For more information, see `PUT Bucket logging
            <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlogging.html>`__ in the
            *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference* .

            - **TargetBucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              Specifies the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server access logs. You can
              have your logs delivered to any bucket that you own, including the same bucket that is
              being logged. You can also configure multiple buckets to deliver their logs to the
              same target bucket. In this case, you should choose a different ``TargetPrefix`` for
              each source bucket so that the delivered log files can be distinguished by key.

            - **TargetGrants** *(list) --*

              Container for granting information.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for granting information.

                - **Grantee** *(dict) --*

                  Container for the person being granted permissions.

                  - **DisplayName** *(string) --*

                    Screen name of the grantee.

                  - **EmailAddress** *(string) --*

                    Email address of the grantee.

                  - **ID** *(string) --*

                    The canonical user ID of the grantee.

                  - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                    Type of grantee

                  - **URI** *(string) --*

                    URI of the grantee group.

                - **Permission** *(string) --*

                  Logging permissions assigned to the Grantee for the bucket.

            - **TargetPrefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              A prefix for all log object keys. If you store log files from multiple Amazon S3
              buckets in a single bucket, you can use a prefix to distinguish which log files came
              from which bucket.

        Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event
        notifications, see `Configuring Event Notifications
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

        Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is
        an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the
        destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an
        event of the specified type.

        By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification
        configuration will be an empty ``NotificationConfiguration`` .

         ``<NotificationConfiguration>``

         ``</NotificationConfiguration>``

        This operation replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you
        include in the request body.

        After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification
        Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and
        that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the
        case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions
        grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more
        information, see `Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

        You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element.

        By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket
        owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration
        with ``s3:PutBucketNotification`` permission.

        .. note::

          The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
          configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you
          send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS
          topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT operation will fail, and Amazon S3 will not
          add the configuration to your bucket.

         **Responses**

        If the configuration in the request body includes only one ``TopicConfiguration`` specifying
        only the ``s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject`` event type, the response will also include the
        ``x-amz-sns-test-message-id`` header containing the message ID of the test notification sent
        to the topic.

        The following operation is related to ``PutBucketNotificationConfiguration`` :

                A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect
                to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect
                to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect
                request to another host where you might process the error.

                - **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals** *(string) --*

                  The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the
                  error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied. Required

                  ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are
                  specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

              - **Redirect** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

                Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to
                another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a
                different error code to return.

                - **HostName** *(string) --*

                  The host name to use in the redirect request.

                - **HttpRedirectCode** *(string) --*

                  The HTTP redirect code to use on the response. Not required if one of the siblings

        Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

        You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the  UploadPart
        operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
        operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all
        the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete
        Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts
        list is complete. This operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For
        each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ``ETag`` value, returned
        after that part was uploaded.

        Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete.
        After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that
        specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends
        white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail
        after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response
        body to determine whether the request succeeded.

        Note that if ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` fails, applications should be prepared to retry the
        failed requests. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Error Best Practices

        Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        .. note::

          Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the  UploadPart operation
          and provide data in your request.

        You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your
        initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must
        include in your upload part request.

        For more information about using the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see the following:

        * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart
        Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        * For information about copying objects using a single atomic operation vs. the multipart
        upload, see `Operations on Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html>`__ in the *Amazon

        * For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys
        with the UploadPartCopy operation, see  CopyObject and  UploadPart .

        Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` ,
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` :

        * **Consideration 1** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; Amazon S3
        returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data.

        * **Consideration 2** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; Amazon S3 returns
        ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code.

         **Versioning**

        If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object.
        By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of the object to copy. If
        the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the
        ``x-amz-copy-source`` , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If
        you specify versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` and the versionId is a delete marker,
        Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker
        as a version for the ``x-amz-copy-source`` .

        You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the
        ``versionId`` subresource as shown in the following example:

         ``x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id``

        Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

        .. note::

          In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to
          specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To
          upload a part from an existing object, you use the  UploadPartCopy operation.

        You must initiate a multipart upload (see  CreateMultipartUpload ) before you can upload any
        part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique
        identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.

        Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely
        identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you
        upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the
        previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the
        last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the
        ``Content-MD5`` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against
        the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.

         **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either
         complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the
         uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees
         up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

        For more information on multipart uploads, go to `Multipart Upload Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple
        Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to
        `Multipart Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have
        the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption
        keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in
        the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using
        CreateMultipartUpload . For more information, go to `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using
        a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in
        each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption
        parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
        CreateMultipartUpload .

        If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your
        initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each
        part upload using the following headers.

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        :type Body: bytes or seekable file-like object
        :param Body:

          Object data.

        :type ContentLength: integer
        :param ContentLength:

          Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body cannot be
          determined automatically.

        :type ContentMD5: string
        :param ContentMD5:

          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data. This parameter is auto-populated
          when using the command from the CLI. This parameter is required if object lock parameters
          are specified.

        :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
        :param SSECustomerAlgorithm:

          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

        :type SSECustomerKey: string
        :param SSECustomerKey:

          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
          This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store
          the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in
          the ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm header`` . This must be the same
          encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload request.

        :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
        :param SSECustomerKeyMD5:

          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3
          uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was
          transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided.
            Including this parameter is not required

        :type RequestPayer: string
        :param RequestPayer:

          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the request. Bucket
          owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about
          downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requestor

        Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

        .. note::

          You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your
          object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, for
          copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy
          API. For more information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__ .

        When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata.
        However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To
        override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
        information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ .

        .. warning::

          Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a
          cross-region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request``
          error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__ .

        All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the
        source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST
        Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__
        . Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy
        the object to must be enabled for your account.

        To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the ``Etag`` matches or
        whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` ,
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , or ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` .

        .. note::

          All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source`` , must be signed.

        You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored
        in Amazon S3 using the ``StorageClass`` parameter. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ .

        The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object
        is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption
        keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request
        that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS managed encryption keys or
        by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side
        encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not
        encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side
        Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

        A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while
        Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you
        receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error
        response is embedded in the ``200 OK`` response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can
        contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the
        response and handle it appropriately.

        If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

        .. note::

          If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it
          would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

        Consider the following when using request headers:

        * Consideration 1 – If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false

        * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code:

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true

        The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the
        destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 Pricing
        <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__ .

        Following are other considerations when using ``CopyObject`` :

          Versioning

        By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If
        the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To
        copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for
        the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source
        object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the ``x-amz-version-id``
        response header in the response.

        If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that
        Amazon S3 generates is always null.

        If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object
        before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request
        headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or
        provide your own encryption key.

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS managed encryption
        key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.

          * ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption``

          * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id``

          * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context``

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed customer
          master key (CMK) in AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an encryption key that you
        provide, use the following headers.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        * If the source object is encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided
        encryption keys, you must use the following headers.

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-copy-source-​server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
        more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly, use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        The following operations are related to ``CopyObject`` :

        *  PutObject

        *  GetObject

        For more information, see `Copying Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html>`__ .

        Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which
        becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not
        remove any objects.

        To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id
        subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted
        is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true.

        If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is
        MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE
        ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS.

        For more information about MFA Delete, see `Using MFA Delete
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html>`__ . To see sample
        requests that use versioning, see `Sample Request
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete>`__
        .

        You can delete objects by explicitly calling the DELETE Object API or configure its
        lifecycle ( PutBucketLifecycle ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to
        block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny
        them the ``s3:DeleteObject`` , ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion`` , and
        ``s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration`` actions.

        Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the
        object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object
        without using an authorization header.

        An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer
        file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that
        imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can
        name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

        To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in
        the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object
        ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as
        ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the
        object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify
        the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information
        about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__
        .

        To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent.
        For more information, see `Amazon S3 Torrent
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html>`__ . For more information
        about returning the ACL of an object, see  GetObjectAcl .

        If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes,
        before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this
        operation returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring
        archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ .

        Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
        GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your
        object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must
        use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
        ``s3:GetObjectVersionTagging`` action), the response also returns the
        ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the
        object. You can use  GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status
        code 403 ("access denied") error.

         **Versioning**

        By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a
        different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        .. note::

          If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the
          object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.

        For more information about versioning, see  PutBucketVersioning .

         **Overriding Response Header Values**

        There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response.
        For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET
        request.

        You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters.
        These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status
        code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a
        subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers
        that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` ,
        ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To
        override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

        .. note::

          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when
          using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

        * ``response-content-type``

        * ``response-content-language``

        * ``response-expires``

        * ``response-cache-control``

        * ``response-content-disposition``

        * ``response-content-encoding``

         **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**

        If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request
        as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since``
        condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

        If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the
        request as follows:``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified
        response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) --

              Object data.

            - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker.
              If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

            - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --*

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the
              restored object copy.

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

              Last modified date of the object

            - **ContentLength** *(integer) --*

              Size of the body in bytes.

            - **ETag** *(string) --*

              An ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a
              resource found at a URL.

            - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --*

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers.
              This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more
              flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata
              whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              Version of the object.

            - **CacheControl** *(string) --*

              Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

            - **ContentDisposition** *(string) --*

              Specifies presentational information for the object.

            - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --*

              Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what
              decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the
              Content-Type header field.

            - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --*

              The language the content is in.

            - **ContentType** *(string) --*

              A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

            - **Expires** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for
              example, AES256, aws:kms).

            - **Metadata** *(dict) --*

              A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

              - *(string) --*

            - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
              master key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --*

        """
        This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used
        to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID
        in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see  UploadPart ). You also include this
        upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.

        For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ .

        If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload
        must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration.
        Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and
        Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete
        Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__
        .

        For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see
        `Multipart Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ .

        For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a
        multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart
        upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
        multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests
        (AWS Signature Version 4)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged
          for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
          Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing
          them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you
        access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS
        KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to
        provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in  UploadPart ) and
        UploadPartCopy ) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the
        upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` .

        To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have
        permission to the ``kms:Encrypt`` , ``kms:Decrypt`` , ``kms:ReEncrypt*`` ,
        ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` , and ``kms:DescribeKey`` actions on the key. These permissions are
        required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before
        it completes the multipart upload.

        If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as
        the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or
        role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both
        the key policy and your IAM user or role.

        For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in
          AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
        more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly, use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        The following operations are related to ``CreateMultipartUpload`` :

        *  UploadPart

        *  CompleteMultipartUpload

        *  AbortMultipartUpload

        *  ListParts

        *  ListMultipartUploads

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3-2006-03-01/CreateMultipartUpload>`_

        :param GrantWriteACP:

          Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

        :type Metadata: dict
        :param Metadata:

          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          - *(string) --*

            - *(string) --*

        :type ServerSideEncryption: string
        :param ServerSideEncryption:

          The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for
          example, AES256, aws:kms).

        :type StorageClass: string
        :param StorageClass:

          The type of storage to use for the object. Defaults to 'STANDARD'.

        :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string
        :param WebsiteRedirectLocation:

          If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another
          object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header
          in the object metadata.

        :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
        :param SSECustomerAlgorithm:

          Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

        :type SSECustomerKey: string
        :param SSECustomerKey:

          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
          This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store
          the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in
          the ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm`` header.

        :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
        :param SSECustomerKeyMD5:

          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3
          uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was
          transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided.
            Including this parameter is not required

        :type SSEKMSKeyId: string
        :param SSEKMSKeyId:

          Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an
          object protected by AWS KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information
          about configuring using any of the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS CLI, see
          `Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http:/docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version>`__
          in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide* .

        :type SSEKMSEncryptionContext: string
        :param SSEKMSEncryptionContext:

          Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this
          header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value
          pairs.

        :type RequestPayer: string
        :param RequestPayer:

          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the request. Bucket
          owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about
          downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requestor
          Pays Buckets

        Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to
        it.

        Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the
        entire object to the bucket.

        Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same
        object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not
        provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer
        or use versioning instead.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header.
        When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if
        they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting
        an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

        .. note::

          To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body,
          use the ``100-continue`` HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid
          sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example,
          because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the
          ``100-continue`` HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of
          `http\\://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt>`__ .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when
        you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed
        encryption keys. For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific
        permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request
        headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in
          AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          .. warning::

             Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS
             Regions:

              * US East (N. Virginia)

              * US West (N. California)

              * US West (Oregon)

              * Asia Pacific (Singapore)

              * Asia Pacific (Sydney)

              * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

              * EU (Ireland)

              * South America (São Paulo)

            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and
            Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the
            AWS General Reference

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the default AWS KMS CMK
          to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

        .. note::

           If you use this feature, the ETag value that Amazon S3 returns in the response is not the
           MD5 of the object.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

         **Storage Class Options**

        By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly created objects. The
        Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other
        storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the
        Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

         **Versioning**

        If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID
        for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the
        ``x-amz-version-id response`` header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null
        as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning
        state of a bucket, see  GetBucketVersioning . If you enable versioning for a bucket, when
        Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all
        of the objects.

          The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the headers) according to
          RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message integrity check to verify that the data is
          the same data that was originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the
          Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more information about REST

        :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string
        :param WebsiteRedirectLocation:

          If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another
          object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header
          in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and
          Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`__ .

          In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object
          (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

           ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html``

          In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:

           ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/``

        :type SSECustomerKey: string
        :param SSECustomerKey:

          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
          This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store
          the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in
          the ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm`` header.

        :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
        :param SSECustomerKeyMD5:

          Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3
          uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was
          transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided.
            Including this parameter is not required

          (CMK) that was used for the object.

          If the value of ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` is ``aws:kms`` , this header specifies
          the ID of the AWS KMS CMK that will be used for the object. If you specify
          ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but do not
          provide``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed
          CMK in AWS to protect the data.

        :type SSEKMSEncryptionContext: string
        :param SSEKMSEncryptionContext:

          Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this

        Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

        This operation performs the following types of requests:

        * ``select`` - Perform a select query on an archived object

        * ``restore an archive`` - Restore an archived object

        To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:RestoreObject`` and
        ``s3:GetObject`` actions. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this
        permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to
        Bucket Subresource Operations
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__
        and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources

        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Querying Archives with Select Requests**

        You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived
        objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed
        comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your
        archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
        overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, do the following:

        * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket
        in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried.
        The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You
        can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket.
        For more information about output, see `Querying Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* . For more information about the ``S3``
        structure in the request body, see the following:

          *  PutObject

          * `Managing Access with ACLs
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ in the *Amazon
          Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*

          * `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the
          *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*

        * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the
        request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following
        examples.

          * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM
          Object``

          * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can
          specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 >
          100``

          * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the
          request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the
          ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You
          cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN
          FROM S3Object s``

        For more information about using SQL with Glacier Select restore, see `SQL Reference for
        Amazon S3 Select and Glacier Select
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, you can also do the following:

        * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about
        tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

        * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being
        queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.

        The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

        * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored
        until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.

        * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't
        deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.

        * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select
        request doesn’t return error response ``409`` .

         **Restoring Archives**

        Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived
        object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the
        archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the
        restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but
        the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was
        restored from.

        To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a
        version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

        The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being
        restored from and which data access tier you specify.

        When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the
        following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body:

        * **``Expedited`` ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in
        the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are
        required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
        retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
        that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
        retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Standard`` ** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
        within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval
        requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete
        within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from
        the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Bulk`` ** - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option,
        enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk
        retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically
        complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for
        ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed
        while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing
        another restore request to the same object, setting a new ``Tier`` request element. When
        issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than
        the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters,
        such as the ``Days`` request element. For more information, see `Upgrading the Speed of an
        In-Progress Restore
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return
        the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in
        the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is
        initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the
        request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current
        time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update
        the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request
        for the object.

        If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action,
        the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For
        example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in
        3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle
        configuration, see  PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and `Object Lifecycle Management
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Responses**

        A successful operation returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code.

        * If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in
        the response.

        * If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.

         **Special Errors**

        *

          * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*

          * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type
          requests.)*

          * *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*

          * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*

                  * ``NONE`` : First line is not a header.

                  * ``IGNORE`` : First line is a header, but you can't use the header values to
                  indicate the column in an expression. You can use column position (such as _1, _2,
                  …) to indicate the column (``SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s`` ).

                  * ``Use`` : First line is a header, and you can use the header value to identify a

        Uses the ``acl`` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for an object
        that already exists in a bucket. You must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission to set the ACL of an
        object.

        Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either
        the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that
        updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach.

         **Access Permissions**

        You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of
        predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
        permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-ac`` l. If you use this
        header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS
        accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
        headers, you cannot use ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to
        the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access
        Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . You specify each
        grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants list objects permission to the
        two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

         **Grantee Values**

        You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request
        elements) in the following ways:

        * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``
        The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request,
        appears as the CanonicalUser.

        * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
        </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.

        * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type=
            "Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``

         **Versioning**

        The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the
        current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the ``versionId``
        subresource.

        Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

        .. note::

          You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your
          object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation using this API. However, for
          copying an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy
          API. For more information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__ .

        When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata.
        However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To
        override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
        information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ .

        .. warning::

          Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-region copies. If you request a
          cross-region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request``
          error. For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__ .

        All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the
        source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST
        Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__
        . Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy
        the object to must be enabled for your account.

        To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the ``Etag`` matches or
        whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the request parameters
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` ,
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , or ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` .

        .. note::

          All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source`` , must be signed.

        You can use this operation to change the storage class of an object that is already stored
        in Amazon S3 using the ``StorageClass`` parameter. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ .

        The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted. If the source object
        is encrypted, it can be encrypted by server-side encryption using AWS managed encryption
        keys or by using a customer-provided encryption key. When copying an object, you can request
        that Amazon S3 encrypt the target object by using either the AWS managed encryption keys or
        by using your own encryption key. You can do this regardless of the form of server-side
        encryption that was used to encrypt the source, or even if the source object was not
        encrypted. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side
        Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

        A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while
        Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy operation starts, you
        receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error
        response is embedded in the ``200 OK`` response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can
        contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the
        response and handle it appropriately.

        If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

        .. note::

          If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it
          would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

        Consider the following when using request headers:

        * Consideration 1 – If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false

        * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and
        ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as
        follows, Amazon S3 returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code:

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false

          * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true

        The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region you specify for the
        destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 Pricing
        <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__ .

        Following are other considerations when using ``CopyObject`` :

          Versioning

        By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. (If
        the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted.) To
        copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for
        the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source
        object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the ``x-amz-version-id``
        response header in the response.

        If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that
        Amazon S3 generates is always null.

        If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object
        before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        To encrypt the target object, you must provide the appropriate encryption-related request
        headers. The one you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or
        provide your own encryption key.

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an AWS managed encryption
        key, provide the following request headers, as appropriate.

          * ``x-amz-server-side​-encryption``

          * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id``

          * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context``

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed customer
          master key (CMK) in AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * To encrypt the target object using server-side encryption with an encryption key that you
        provide, use the following headers.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        * If the source object is encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided
        encryption keys, you must use the following headers.

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-copy-source​-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-copy-source-​server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in Amazon KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
        more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly, use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        The following operations are related to ``CopyObject`` :

        *  PutObject

        *  GetObject

        For more information, see `Copying Objects

        object, and optional version ID of the source object.  You can either provide this value as
        a string or a dictionary.  The string form is {bucket}/{key} or
        {bucket}/{key}?versionId={versionId} if you want to copy a specific version.  You can also
        provide this value as a dictionary.  The dictionary format is recommended over the string
        format because it is more explicit.  The dictionary format is: {'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key':
        'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}.  Note that the VersionId key is optional and may be omitted.

        Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the
        object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object
        without using an authorization header.

        An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer
        file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that
        imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can
        name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

        To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in
        the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object
        ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as
        ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the
        object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify
        the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information
        about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__

        To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent.
        For more information, see `Amazon S3 Torrent

        about returning the ACL of an object, see  GetObjectAcl .

        If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes,
        before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this
        operation returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring
        archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ .

        Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
        GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your
        object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must
        use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
        ``s3:GetObjectVersionTagging`` action), the response also returns the
        ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the
        object. You can use  GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status
        code 403 ("access denied") error.

         **Versioning**

        By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a
        different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        .. note::

          If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the
          object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.

        For more information about versioning, see  PutBucketVersioning .

         **Overriding Response Header Values**

        There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response.
        For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET
        request.

        You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters.
        These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status
        code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a
        subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers
        that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` ,
        ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To
        override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

        .. note::

          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when

         **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**

        If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request
        as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since``
        condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

        If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the
        request as follows:``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified
        response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the
              restored object copy.

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

              Last modified date of the object

            - **ContentLength** *(integer) --*

              Size of the body in bytes.

            - **ETag** *(string) --*

            - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --*

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers.
              This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more
              flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata
              whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              Version of the object.

            - **Expires** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for

            - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
              master key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --*

        This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used
        to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID
        in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see  UploadPart ). You also include this
        upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.

        For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ .

        If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload
        must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration.
        Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and
        Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete
        Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__
        .

        For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see
        `Multipart Upload API and Permissions
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ .

        For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a
        multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart
        upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
        multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests
        (AWS Signature Version 4)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged
          for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
          Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing
          them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you
        access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS
        KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to
        provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in  UploadPart ) and
        UploadPartCopy ) requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the
        upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` .

        To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have
        permission to the ``kms:Encrypt`` , ``kms:Decrypt`` , ``kms:ReEncrypt*`` ,
        ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` , and ``kms:DescribeKey`` actions on the key. These permissions are
        required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before
        it completes the multipart upload.

        If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as
        the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or
        role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both
        the key policy and your IAM user or role.

        For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
        granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions
        using the request headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in
          AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
        more information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly, use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by
        email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

        The following operations are related to ``CreateMultipartUpload`` :

        *  UploadPart

        *  CompleteMultipartUpload

        *  AbortMultipartUpload

        *  ListParts

        *  ListMultipartUploads

        Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to
        it.

        Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the
        entire object to the bucket.

        Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same
        object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not
        provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer
        or use versioning instead.

        To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header.
        When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if
        they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting
        an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

        .. note::

          To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request body,
          use the ``100-continue`` HTTP status code. For PUT operations, this helps you avoid
          sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the headers (for example,
          because authentication fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the
          ``100-continue`` HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of
          `http\\://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt>`__ .

        You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3
        encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when
        you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed
        encryption keys. For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ .

          Access Permissions

        You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific
        permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request
        headers:

        * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see
        `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__
        .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` ,
        ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control``
        headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
        For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ .

        You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do
        both.

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in
          AWS KMS to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

          Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

        You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By
        default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
        object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
        by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the
        object. For more information, see `Using ACLs
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ . With this
        operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

        * Specify a canned ACL (``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known
        as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
        information, see `Canned ACL
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__ .

        * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific
        AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions
        that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL)
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ . In the
        header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions
        explicitly use:

          * x-amz-grant-read

          * x-amz-grant-write

          * x-amz-grant-read-acp

          * x-amz-grant-write-acp

          * x-amz-grant-full-control

        You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

          * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account

          .. warning::

             Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS
             Regions:

              * US East (N. Virginia)

              * US West (N. California)

          * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group

        For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the AWS accounts identified by

         ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``

          Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

        You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption.
        Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you
        use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed encryption keys or provide your own
        encryption key.

        * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
        Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
        specify the following headers in the request.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

          * x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

        .. note::

          If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide
          ``x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the default AWS KMS CMK
          to protect the data.

        .. warning::

          All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them
          with SSL or by using SigV4.

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

        * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys,
        provide all the following headers in the request.

        .. note::

           If you use this feature, the ETag value that Amazon S3 returns in the response is not the
           MD5 of the object.

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

          * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see
        `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ .

         **Storage Class Options**

        By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly created objects. The
        Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other
        storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see `Storage
        Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the
        Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

         **Versioning**

        If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID
        for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the
        ``x-amz-version-id response`` header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null
        as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning
        state of a bucket, see  GetBucketVersioning . If you enable versioning for a bucket, when
        Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all
        of the objects.

         **Querying Archives with Select Requests**

        You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived
        objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed
        comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your
        archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
        overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the
        *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, do the following:

        * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket
        in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried.
        The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You
        can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket.

        * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the
        request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following
        examples.

          * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM
          Object``

          * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can
          specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 >
          100``

          * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the
          request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the
          ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You
          cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN
          FROM S3Object s``

        For more information about using SQL with Glacier Select restore, see `SQL Reference for
        Amazon S3 Select and Glacier Select
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in
        the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        When making a select request, you can also do the following:

        * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about
        tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

        * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being
        queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.

        The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

        * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored
        until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.

        * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't
        deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.

        * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select
        request doesn’t return error response ``409`` .

         **Restoring Archives**

        Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived
        object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the
        archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the
        restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but
        the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was
        restored from.

        To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a
        version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

        The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being
        restored from and which data access tier you specify.

        When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the
        following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body:

        * **``Expedited`` ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in
        the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are
        required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
        retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
        that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
        retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Standard`` ** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
        within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval
        requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete
        within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from
        the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        * **``Bulk`` ** - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option,
        enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk
        retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically
        complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.

        For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for
        ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed
        while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing
        another restore request to the same object, setting a new ``Tier`` request element. When
        issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than
        the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters,
        such as the ``Days`` request element. For more information, see `Upgrading the Speed of an
        In-Progress Restore
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return
        the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in
        the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is
        initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

        After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the
        request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current
        time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update
        the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request
        for the object.

        If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action,
        the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For
        example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in
        3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle
        configuration, see  PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and `Object Lifecycle Management
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon
        Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

         **Responses**

        A successful operation returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code.

        * If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in
        the response.

        * If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.

         **Special Errors**

        *

          * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*

          * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type
          requests.)*

          * *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*

          * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*

        *

          * *Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable*

          * *Cause: Glacier expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later.
          (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to process the Expedited request. This error
          applies only to Expedited retrievals and not to Standard or Bulk retrievals.)*

          * *HTTP Status Code: 503*

          Container for restore job parameters.

          - **Days** *(integer) --*

            Lifetime of the active copy in days. Do not use with restores that specify
            ``OutputLocation`` .

          - **GlacierJobParameters** *(dict) --*

            Glacier related parameters pertaining to this job. Do not use with restores that specify

              Glacier retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          - **Type** *(string) --*

            Type of restore request.

          - **Tier** *(string) --*

            Glacier retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed.

          - **Description** *(string) --*

            The optional description for the job.

          - **SelectParameters** *(dict) --*

            Describes the parameters for Select job types.

            - **InputSerialization** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              Describes the serialization format of the object.

              - **CSV** *(dict) --*

                Describes the serialization of a CSV-encoded object.

                - **FileHeaderInfo** *(string) --*

                  Describes the first line of input. Valid values are:

                  * ``NONE`` : First line is not a header.

                  * ``IGNORE`` : First line is a header, but you can't use the header values to
                  indicate the column in an expression. You can use column position (such as _1, _2,
                  …) to indicate the column (``SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s`` ).

                  * ``Use`` : First line is a header, and you can use the header value to identify a
                  column in an expression (``SELECT "name" FROM OBJECT`` ).

                - **Comments** *(string) --*

                  A single character used to indicate that a row should be ignored when the
                  character is present at the start of that row. You can specify any character to
                  indicate a comment line.

                - **QuoteEscapeCharacter** *(string) --*

                  A single character used for escaping the quotation mark character inside an
                  already escaped value. For example, the value ''' a , b ''' is parsed as " a , b
                  ".

                - **RecordDelimiter** *(string) --*

                  A single character used to separate individual records in the input. Instead of
                  the default value, you can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

                - **FieldDelimiter** *(string) --*

                  A single character used to separate individual fields in a record. You can specify
                  an arbitrary delimiter.

                - **QuoteCharacter** *(string) --*

                  A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter is part of the
                  value. For example, if the value is ``a, b`` , Amazon S3 wraps this field value in
                  quotation marks, as follows: ``" a , b "`` .

                  Type: String

                  Default: ``"``

                  Ancestors: ``CSV``

                - **AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter** *(boolean) --*

                  Specifies that CSV field values may contain quoted record delimiters and such
                  records should be allowed. Default value is FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may
                  lower performance.

              - **CompressionType** *(string) --*

                Specifies object's compression format. Valid values: NONE, GZIP, BZIP2. Default
                Value: NONE.

              - **JSON** *(dict) --*

                Specifies JSON as object's input serialization format.

                - **Type** *(string) --*

                  The type of JSON. Valid values: Document, Lines.

        To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id
        subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted
        is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true.

        If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is
        MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE
        ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS.

        Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the
        object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object
        without using an authorization header.

        An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer
        file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that
        imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can
        name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

        To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in
        the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object
        ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as
        ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the
        object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify
        the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information
        about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__
        .

        To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent.
        For more information, see `Amazon S3 Torrent
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html>`__ . For more information
        about returning the ACL of an object, see  GetObjectAcl .

        If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes,
        before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this
        operation returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring
        archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ .

        Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
        GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
        (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your
        object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must
        use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
        ``s3:GetObjectVersionTagging`` action), the response also returns the
        ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the
        object. You can use  GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status
        code 403 ("access denied") error.

         **Versioning**

        By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object. To return a
        different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

        .. note::

          If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the
          object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.

        For more information about versioning, see  PutBucketVersioning .

         **Overriding Response Header Values**

        There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response.
        For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET
        request.

        You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters.
        These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status
        code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a
        subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers
        that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` ,
        ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To
        override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

        .. note::

          You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when
          using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

        * ``response-content-type``

        * ``response-content-language``

        * ``response-expires``

        * ``response-cache-control``

        * ``response-content-disposition``

        * ``response-content-encoding``

         **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**

        If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request
        as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since``
        condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.

        If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the
        request as follows:``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;
        ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified
        response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

          - *(dict) --*

            - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) --

              Object data.

            - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker.
              If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

            - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --*

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              Provides information about object restoration operation and expiration time of the
              restored object copy.

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

              Last modified date of the object

            - **ContentLength** *(integer) --*

              Size of the body in bytes.

            - **ETag** *(string) --*

              An ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a
              resource found at a URL.

            - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --*

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers.
              This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more
              flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata
              whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              Version of the object.

            - **CacheControl** *(string) --*

              Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

            - **ContentDisposition** *(string) --*

              Specifies presentational information for the object.

            - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --*

              Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what
              decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the
              Content-Type header field.

            - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --*

              The language the content is in.

            - **ContentRange** *(string) --*

              The portion of the object returned in the response.

            - **ContentType** *(string) --*

              A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

            - **Expires** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for
              example, AES256, aws:kms).

            - **Metadata** *(dict) --*

              A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

              - *(string) --*

                - *(string) --*

            - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
              master key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --*

              Amazon S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or
              destination in a replication rule.

            - **PartsCount** *(integer) --*

              The count of parts this object has.

            - **TagCount** *(integer) --*

              The number of tags, if any, on the object.

            - **ObjectLockMode** *(string) --*

              The Object Lock mode currently in place for this object.

            - **ObjectLockRetainUntilDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time when this object's Object Lock will expire.

            - **ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus** *(string) --*

              Indicates whether this object has an active legal hold. This field is only returned if
              you have permission to view an object's legal hold status.

        """
        The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself.
        This operation is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you
        must have READ access to the object.

        A ``HEAD`` request has the same options as a ``GET`` operation on an object. The response is
        identical to the ``GET`` response except that there is no response body.

        If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
        keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata
        from the object, you must use the following headers:

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-algorithm

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key

        * x-amz-server-side​-encryption​-customer-key-MD5

        For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
        Encryption Keys)
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ .

        .. note::

          Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for
          GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
          (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If
          your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

        Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see `Common Request
        Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html>`__ .

        Consider the following when using request headers:

        * Consideration 1 – If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are
        present in the request as follows:

          * ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;

          * ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ;

        Then Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and the data requested.

        * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are
        present in the request as follows:

          * ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;

          * ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ;

        Then Amazon S3 returns the ``304 Not Modified`` response code.

        For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__ .

         **Permissions**

        You need the ``s3:GetObject`` permission for this operation. For more information, see
        `Specifying Permissions in a Policy
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ . If the
        object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also
        have the s3:ListBucket permission.

        * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP
        status code 404 ("no such key") error.

        * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code
        403 ("access denied") error.

        The following operation is related to ``HeadObject`` :

        *  GetObject

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

              Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker.
              If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

            - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --*

              Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

            - **Expiration** *(string) --*

              If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response
              includes this header. It includes the expiry-date and rule-id key-value pairs
              providing object expiration information. The value of the rule-id is URL encoded.

            - **Restore** *(string) --*

              If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the
              response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see
              RestoreObject or an archive copy is already restored.

              If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is
              scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

               ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date=
                   "Fri, 23 Dec 2012 00:00:00
               GMT"``

              If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value
              ``ongoing-request="true"`` .

              For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\\: General
              Considerations
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__
              .

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --*

              Last modified date of the object

            - **ContentLength** *(integer) --*

              Size of the body in bytes.

            - **ETag** *(string) --*

              An ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a
              resource found at a URL.

            - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --*

              This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers.
              This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more
              flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata
              whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

            - **VersionId** *(string) --*

              Version of the object.

            - **CacheControl** *(string) --*

              Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

            - **ContentDisposition** *(string) --*

              Specifies presentational information for the object.

            - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --*

              Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what
              decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the
              Content-Type header field.

            - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --*

              The language the content is in.

            - **ContentType** *(string) --*

              A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

            - **Expires** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

            - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --*

              If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to
              another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of
              this header in the object metadata.

            - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --*

              If the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an AWS KMS customer
              master key (CMK) or an Amazon S3-managed encryption key, the response includes this
              header with the value of the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this
              object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

            - **Metadata** *(dict) --*

              A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

              - *(string) --*

                - *(string) --*

            - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

            - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

              If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the
              response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification
              of the customer-provided encryption key.

            - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --*

              If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
              master key (CMK) that was used for the object.

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --*

              Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for
              all objects except for Standard storage class objects.

              For more information, see `Storage Classes
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ .

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --*

              Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a
              source or destination in a replication rule.

              In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and
              destination bucket where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object
              (``GetObject`` ) or object metadata (``HeadObject`` ) from these buckets, Amazon S3
              will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header in the response as follows:

              * If requesting an object from the source bucket — Amazon S3 will return the
              ``x-amz-replication-status`` header if the object in your request is eligible for
              replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify
              object prefix ``TaxDocs`` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix
              ``TaxDocs`` . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example
              ``TaxDocs/document1.pdf`` , are eligible for replication. For any object request with
              this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header
              with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.

              * If requesting an object from the destination bucket — Amazon S3 will return the
              ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value REPLICA if the object in your request
              is a replica that Amazon S3 created.

              For more information, see `Replication
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ .

            - **PartsCount** *(integer) --*

              The count of parts this object has.

            - **ObjectLockMode** *(string) --*

              The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission. For more
              information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock
              <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__ .

            - **ObjectLockRetainUntilDate** *(datetime) --*

              The date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission.

            - **ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus** *(string) --*

              Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only
              returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectLegalHold`` permission. This header is
              not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold
              applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock

          cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that

          specified ``key-marker`` will be included in the list.

          If ``upload-id-marker`` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the

          Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You

        """
        This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
        request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
        suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

        The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
        provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
        version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
        delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
        response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns
        the result as deleted.

        The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
        operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
        key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
        operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any
        information about the delete in the response body.

        When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any
        versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
        request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
        provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire
        Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__
        .

        Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3
        uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

        The following operations are related to ``DeleteObjects`` :

        *  CreateMultipartUpload

        *  UploadPart

        *  CompleteMultipartUpload

              successfully deleted.

              - *(dict) --*

                Information about the deleted object.

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The name of the deleted object.

                - **VersionId** *(string) --*

                  The version ID of the deleted object.

                - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --*

                  Specifies whether the versioned object that was permanently deleted was (true) or
                  was not (false) a delete marker. In a simple DELETE, this header indicates whether
                  (true) or not (false) a delete marker was created.

                - **DeleteMarkerVersionId** *(string) --*

                  The version ID of the delete marker created as a result of the DELETE operation.
                  If you delete a specific object version, the value returned by this header is the
                  version ID of the object version deleted.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

            - **Errors** *(list) --*

              Container for a failed delete operation that describes the object that Amazon S3
              attempted to delete and the error it encountered.

              - *(dict) --*

                Container for all error elements.

                - **Key** *(string) --*

                  The error key.

                - **VersionId** *(string) --*

                  The version ID of the error.

                - **Code** *(string) --*

                  The error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error condition. It is
                  meant to be read and understood by programs that detect and handle errors by type.

                  The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in
                  English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message
                  directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how
                  or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error
                  handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
                  message.

          A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same
          string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under
          a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against
          the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

        :type EncodingType: string
        :param EncodingType:

          Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding
          method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser
          cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
          characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that
          Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

        :param MaxKeys:

          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response might contain fewer
          keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were
          not returned because max-keys was exceeded, the response contains
          <isTruncated>true</isTruncated>. To return the additional keys, see key-marker and
          version-id-marker.

          Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can
          use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of
          using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can
          use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under
          CommonPrefixes.

        """
        This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
        request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a
        suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

        The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
        provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
        version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
        delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
        response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns
        the result as deleted.

        The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
        operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
        key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
        operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any
        information about the delete in the response body.

        When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any
        versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
        request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
        provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire
        Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__
        .

        Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3
        uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

              BypassGovernanceRetention=True|False
          )
        :type MFA: string
        :param MFA:

          The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value
          that is displayed on your authentication device. Required to permanently delete a
          versioned object if versioning is configured with MFA delete enabled.

        :type RequestPayer: string
        :param RequestPayer:

          Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the request. Bucket
          owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about
          downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requestor

                  Specifies whether the versioned object that was permanently deleted was (true) or
                  was not (false) a delete marker. In a simple DELETE, this header indicates whether
                  (true) or not (false) a delete marker was created.

                - **DeleteMarkerVersionId** *(string) --*

                  The version ID of the delete marker created as a result of the DELETE operation.
                  If you delete a specific object version, the value returned by this header is the
                  version ID of the object version deleted.

            - **RequestCharged** *(string) --*

              If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

                  The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in
                  English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message
                  directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how
                  or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error
                  handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
                  message.
