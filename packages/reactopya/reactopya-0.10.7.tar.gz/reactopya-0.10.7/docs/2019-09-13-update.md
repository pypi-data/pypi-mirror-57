Update: just released reactopya 0.7.0 and ephys-viz 0.6.0.

I went down into a refactoring pit for a few days, but I managed to emerge
without significantly modifying ephys-viz -- the idea is that the reactopya
framework may improve internally, but the packages that use it should be
reasonably well-defined and stable.

The main capability I added was to be able to dynamically add child widgets from
within the javascript (and still allow it to be serialized into an html
snapshot). The child widgets have their own python backends, so the message
passing all has to go through the parent widget. This type of dynamic behavior
is important for the following widget: NWBFile -- It shows the contents of any
.nwb file with plugin views that smartly know how to display themselves
DEPENDING on the content of the .nwb file. For a first pass I only have 2 plugin
views:

(1) Show the raw file content (like what I have been calling NWBBrowser - but
that name will change) (2) Cortical surfaces.

So, here's an html snapshot showing this widget with an example file. Warning:
it is 50MB so you may not want to click on it with your phone:
