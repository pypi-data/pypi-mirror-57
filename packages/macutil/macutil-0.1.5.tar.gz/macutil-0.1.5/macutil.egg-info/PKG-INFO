        MAC Address brute forcing tool, used to bypass MAC based filtering
        
        Network Access Control solutions are a simple idea, 802.1X cert based 
        authentication, great! works like a charm. However, businesses are complex 
        beasts and not all systems on that network support 802.1X and/or cert based 
        authenticaiton.
         
        In this situation most look to simple MAC authentication to handle the
        exceptions. 
         
        So if lets say your IP phones are on the same network, if we can find the
        correct MAC address we can essential spoof that address and access the network.
        
        This utility was designed for exactly this, MAC address manipulation and brute
        forcing.
