'''
    lygadgets.Technology serves as a drop-in for pya.Technology in the pymod standalone.

    The difference is that the lygadgets version loads all the installed technologies in salt.
    This is not a bug. The intention of pymod:pya.Technology is to isolate from the state of a user's machine,
    but some packages are not associated with a particular technology, so they have to get it from salt.

    Nothing happens on import: Autoload from salt is triggered when you ask for either
    - Technology.technology_names, or
    - Technology.technology_by_name, or
    - Technology.has_technology

    lygadgets.Technology also offers a new method: register_lyt
    which takes the .lyt file, turns it into a Technology object (eventually returns), and adds to the class registry
