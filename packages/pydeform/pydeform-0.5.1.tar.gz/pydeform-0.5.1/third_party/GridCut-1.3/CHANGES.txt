1.3 (2015-04-23) : 
 - Added new example "ex03-multilabel" showing multi-label segmentation using alpha-expansion
 - Updated example "ex2-segmentation" to work with PNG images instead of TGAs
 - Added project files for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013

1.2 (2015-02-16) :
 - Multi-threaded solvers now work on Android
 - Exceptions can be disabled by defining the "GRIDCUT_NO_EXCEPTIONS" macro
 - With exceptions disabled, the failure to allocate memory can be tested by calling GridGraph_*::bad_alloc()
 - Stopped including the <windows.h> header in GridGraph_*_MT.h on Windows

1.1 (2012-08-30) :
 - Reduced memory footprint by 10%-25%, depending on graph density and type of edge capacities
 - GridGraph constructor now throws the std::bad_alloc exception when it fails to allocate memory
 - Improved OS X support in multi-threaded solvers
 - Fixed bug which caused GridGraph_2D_8C to return incorrect results
 - Fixed bug causing GridCut to hang on some graphs with floating-point capacities
 - Fixed crash in GridGraph_3D_6C_MT when grid height was smaller than grid depth
 - Fixed compile error in GridGraph_*_MT when function "max" was not defined
 - Fixed compile error when "MIN" or "MAX" macro was defined
 - Fixed bug which caused crash or invalid results under some rare conditions
 - GridGraph_*_MT.h now includes the <windows.h> header more carefully on Windows
 - Fixed unused variable and reordering warnings under GCC
