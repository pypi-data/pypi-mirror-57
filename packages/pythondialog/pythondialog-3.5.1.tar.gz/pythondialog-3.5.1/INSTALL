INSTALLATION
============

Since version 3.5.0, pythondialog is packaged with Setuptools
(previously, it was packaged with Distutils). With the current state of
Python packaging and installation tools, there are several ways to
install pythondialog from source.

Probably, the easiest and cleanest method at this date (December 2019)
is to use pip, possibly inside a virtual environment created with
virtualenv or Python's venv module (venv.py/pyvenv). Typically, assuming
you have a working pip setup (see below), you just have to run one of
the following commands:

  pip install pythondialog       (which normally installs from PyPI)

or

  pip install /path/to/pythondialog-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl

or

  pip install /path/to/python3-pythondialog-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

or

  pip install https://url/to/python3-pythondialog-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

etc.

Notes:
  - very old versions of pip don't support https---better upgrade pip if
    you have such an old version;
  - upgrades can be done by passing '--upgrade' or '-U' to the
    'pip install' command; please refer to the pip documentation for
    details.

Uninstallation should be as easy as:

  pip uninstall pythondialog

So, what is a "working pip setup"?
----------------------------------

What I call a "working pip setup" here is a setup where a command that
is typically something like 'pip', 'pip3' or 'pip3.4' (for a Python 3.4
installation) can be run to safely install, upgrade and remove packages
into or from a particular Python installation.

Normally, a given 'pip' executable is tied to a particular Python
installation that can be discovered by running 'pip --version' (or
'pip3 --version', etc., depending on the particular 'pip' executable
name; for sanity's sake, we'll assume 'pip' in the rest of this
document). For instance, the following would indicate a PythonÂ 3.4
installation based at /some/path:

  % pip --version
  pip 1.5.6 from /some/path/lib/python3.4/site-packages (python 3.4)

In general, it is safe to run 'pip' from a Python interpreter you
installed yourself without a Linux package manager or similar. It is
also safe if the Python interpreter running 'pip' lives in a virtual
environment created with virtualenv or venv.py/pyvenv. The one case
where you should probably avoid using a given 'pip' executable is if it
runs directly under a system Python (typically, /usr/bin/python or
/usr/bin/pythonX.Y) installed with the package manager of your Linux
distribution (or any other OS, for that matter): in such a situation,
'pip' might, if run with superuser privileges, mess with files under the
control of the OS package manager (i.e., 'dpkg' on Debian and its
derivatives, 'rpm' on Redhat and Suse, etc.).

Depending on how you installed Python, you may need superuser privileges
to install, upgrade or remove Python packages inside that installation.
For instance, this will be the case if you compiled Python yourself and
performed the installation step ('make install') as root. However,
running 'pip' with superuser privileges should not be necessary nor
desirable inside a virtual environment created with virtualenv or
venv.py/pyvenv.


Older ways, without pip
-----------------------

The installation method based on pip is much preferred because for one,
it makes uninstallation standard and easy. In case you really can't use
pip, the following instructions should help you install pythondialog,
nevertheless. Here are two ways:

  1) Because pythondialog only needs dialog.py in the proper place to
     work, you may simply copy this file to an appropriate directory for
     your Python installation (probably something like
     <base_dir>/lib/python3.7/site-packages). For uninstallation, simply
     remove the file you copied (also byte-compiled files such as
     dialog.pyc if such files have been created from dialog.py).

  2) Another technique can be used if you have Setuptools installed. In
     this case, you can run:

       python3 ./setup.py build

     from the root of the pythondialog distribution, followed by

       python3 ./setup.py install

     (the second command might need root privileges, depending on where
     you are trying to install). This should create a file such as
     <base_dir>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pythondialog-3.5.1-py3.7.egg
     and add an entry to
     <base_dir>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth that points
     to the .egg file. Uninstallation would then be done with
     '<base_dir>/bin/easy_install -m pythondialog' followed by manual
     removal of the .egg file.

I repeat: the supported method is with pip, as documented earlier in
this file. The tips in this section are only given to help people with
uncommon constraints such as "I can't use pip". Tip 1 (copying
dialog.py) is rather straightforward, no real problem. Tip 2 has been
quickly tested in a venv, appears to work fine but uses deprecated
tools. You can use it, but will be on your own in case things don't go
exactly as you expected.


UNINSTALLATION
==============

If you installed pythondialog with pip, you can uninstall it with the
following command:

  pip uninstall pythondialog

It should be run under the same account that was used to run the
'pip install' command.

On the other hand, if you installed pythondialog using techniques from
the previous section ("Older ways, without pip"), uninstallation
instructions were given there along with each of the mentioned
techniques.
