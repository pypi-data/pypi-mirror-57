Description: i3geoweather
        ============
        
        This blocklet provides temperature information for the i3blocks status bar
        often used in the i3 window manager. It attempts to determine your location
        based on your IP address using the `ipstack.com <http://ipstack.com>`_
        API. Based on the location it retrieves weather information from the free
        `openweathermap.org API`__.

        i3geoweather is a pure Python 3 program. No attempt to make it compatible with
        Python 2 has been or will be made. It is time to switch!
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install i3geoweather is to use pip::
          
          $ pip install i3geoweather
        
        Depending on your system you may need to call pip3 instead of pip
          
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        i3geoweather depends on the Python requests_ library. i3geoweather output uses
        `FontAwesome <http://fontawesome.io>`_ for its output. You should download the
        free FontAwesome zip file and copy fontawesome-webfont.ttf to your ~/.fonts/
        directory. 
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        i3geoweather runs a daemon process in the background (if started with the -d
        option) and periodically updates weather information by writing to
        ~/.i3geoweather/i3geoweather.txt.
        
        Start i3geoweather from your i3 configuration file::
        
          exec_always i3geoweather -d
        
        You may need to use the full path to i3geoweather, e.g., for an installation
        with pip install --user ...::
        
          exec_always ~/.local/bin/i3geoweather -d
          
        A typical i3blocks.conf entry may look like this::
        
          [weather]
          interval=repeat
          command=inotifywait -qq -e delete_self ~/.i3geoweather/i3geoweather.txt && cat ~/.i3geoweather/i3geoweather.txt
        
        Command line options:
        
        - -d or --daemon run as background process
        - -l or --location force a location by specifying a comma separated
          latitude/longitude pair, e.g., -l "50.0126, 7.996". North and east are
          positive. 
        - -r or --restart restart background process
        - -s or --stop stop running background process
        - -v increase verbosity of logging to ~/.i3geoweather/i3geoweather.log. Can be
          used up to three times. Using -v twice logs informational
          messages. Debugging output is produced when -v is used three times.
