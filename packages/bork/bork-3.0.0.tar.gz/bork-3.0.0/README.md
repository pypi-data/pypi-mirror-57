## Installation

```
$ pip3 install bork
```

## Usage

### Downloading Existing Builds


To download a release from GitHub:

```
$ bork download gh:duckinator/emanate # download latest .pyz for Emanate
$ bork download gh:duckinator/emanate --directory bin/ # put files in ./bin
$ bork download gh:ppb/pursuedpybear --files '*.tar.gz' # download latest .tar.gz file
```

To download a wheel from a PyPi release:

```
$ bork download pypi:emanate 6.0.0 --files '*.whl'
```


To download a wheel from a release on PyPi's test instance:

```
$ bork download pypi-test:whaledo 1.0.1 --files '*.whl'
```

### Building and Releasing

Assuming a project is PEP 517 compliant, you can just do:

```
$ bork clean # Remove anything in build/, dist/, *.egg-info/
$ bork build # Build the project
$ bork release # Release to PyPI
```

### ZipApp Support

If you want to build a ZipApp, add this to your setup.cfg:

```
[bork]
zipapp_main = <entrypoint>
```

Where `<entrypoint>` is of the form "module.submodule:function", and
will likely be equivalent to the primary `console_script` entrypoint
elsewhere in setup.cfg.
